1. personally , if i find a toilet clean i ' ll leave it clean , if i find it with litres of other people ' s stale piss everywhere , that ' s how it ' ll stay
   (ID: 68d36e5b5d26327bbb5de8de16430cc93353cbf0)

2. boredom , no chance of winning , you or your killer doesn ' t have a mic on , you have items they want .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

3. why have sex when you know that it is made for reproductive purposes if you aren  t willing to face the consequences ? and i would say we add more because it  s better to be alive and not murdered
   (ID: c0f309bee7152ab458da8ec03fbb1e17fa2876cd)

4. if you want to really clean your computer and uninstall dozen programs you probably won ' t read through every one confirmation window , especially when nearly all have " yes " as confirmation to continue uninstalling .
   (ID: e6e1db90a47dca83004beacbcc9004bec464c7d0)

5. i know a ginger chick that works long hours and hasn  t had an off day in four months . i think she oughta relocate to scotland or ireland because the heat of the usa is not ideal for her freckles and cool hair . then she could be appreciated as she ought to be . sorry , but how did you go from making rational points to simply referencing someone that you think should move away due to their freckles and hair ? does she hate working long hours ? is she happy living in the states , despite the heat ? just came off as really off topic .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

6. i  ve been begging my mom since the start of last weekend and im really impatient because i  m getting it at the end of this week
   (ID: 1e92f1e007a1c147f8200d50f473d5433028bffc)

7. i think the more time we spend fighting about inanimate objects means the less time we can fix the actual problem which is why do people want to shoot other people . all those countries with " amazingly low gun violence numbers " is it because it is hard to get a gun ? or is it because you are doing something about the kind of people who would shoot up a bunch of people .
   (ID: 6fa64e2a9482c3b6f542e4f8f6ab0e5076d808e9)

8. what the hell are you even talking about ? i  outed myself  ? my comment about democrats was part of a response to someone maybe you , i can  t be bothered to go back and verify user names saying something like  spotted the trumptard  to me . there were other comments between those , but that  s the main premise . is the main point of your comment to basically say  hey , twist  digit is a republican !  ? because if that  s the case , you  re wrong . my original comment was to voice my opinion that kaepernick isn  t talented enough to ignore the media circus he brings with him . why you  re making it out to be more than that is fucking beyond me . also , i don  t know why you think i  m going to delete any of this . i stand by everything i said , kaepernick isn  t a great quarterback and he isn  t worth the media circus .
   (ID: 7a396588993d687f5528f10b200dc9d6db769270)

9. i still have to work for another fucking digit hours . it ' s torture
   (ID: 9ee9d24ef531902c3436e80a94ec700625d655c6)

   (ID: 85bffe0bb9cbc6b9878fa42cd379cd2d4c7a27e1)

11. this is probably the worst argument i ' ve ever seen then . i could literally go  hey conservatives eck phlack shmack and it would make about as much sense .
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

12. i heard bananas are great to avoid feel sore . but yes if you want to see changes commitment is key . if you promised your self to go every other day keep it like that , and maintain it . there are days that i feel tired , to the point that i want to sleep and not go to the gym , but it was the day i go so still went all tired , took a shower before working out and still tired but did easy stuff , the feeling of accomplishment is great , and you don  t feel bad that you broke a promise .
   (ID: aef75366751547249854f8779e821b7d0b9b070d)

13. if i had all that gym gear in my home , i most certainly would try that .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

14. couldn ' t agree anymore with your words . this is pure evil .
   (ID: 79bb0063e4d93ebf3f272c94124194ae51d04a55)

15. i have one of those smart  safe apps that hides as a calculator . not used it once .
   (ID: 581212399ab927ef4ad073e5e0d8d36cf5929452)

16. because as much as i detest a lot of the things republicans say and do , nobody can be as obnoxious as a full  bore democrats .
   (ID: 695c696deb58364c4f03bf78d7d406b01f2254e6)

17. it is paradox . you gotta push action button to pick it up . then go beat the past of your character . hope it helps .
   (ID: f35d74d4d36905b144a4851bae7ac6c2014ebdbd)

18. lol . my god . so this is what it ' s about ? being free to choose to kill one self ? you sound like the gun people and for that , i ' m out . i honestly don ' t feel like arguing with someone who has that kind of mindset .
   (ID: d2e08e506c32ac85c9dc9c537b36b64fbe497359)

19. well you can see if you items are still in your stash . you can add another option so it works that way . but you can also do it manually just gab you items and then " rightclick the courier icon to send it back to the first person " many people don ' t know you can do that dx
   (ID: 417f107ec53971c82b0d9bb8ee79067ec512bdbb)

20. well . obviously ? it doesn ' t change that most of the crimes are carried out by people with illegal guns , most probably stolen from somewhere i meah , hell , most of knives people get stabbed by start out as kitchen knives , is it time to ban kitchen knives ?
