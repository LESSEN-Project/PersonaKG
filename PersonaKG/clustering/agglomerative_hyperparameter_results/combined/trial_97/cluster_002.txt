13. for me it was a slow progression . i used to be very social . always partying . always out and about with different groups of people doing random shit . eventually , i got sick of partying and distance grew between those friends who still loved it . between working during the day and wanting to explore new things after work we didn ' t really have schedules that lined up . occasionally i ' d suck it up and attend a kickback or party but it wasn ' t really my crowd anymore so we ' d spend less and less time together and just became social media friends . a good nintey percent of my friends i lost due to  people moving , going off to school , being busy with work , getting pregnant and married , becoming untrustworthy , etc . i ' m an introvert at heart so it didn ' t really bother me . now , i had time to focus on learning and practicing instruments , drawing , educating myself by downloading pdf files of college books etc , writing , skating , i started playing video games again . when i turned twenty i became heavily involved with activism . for the next seven years i spent my time between the things i focused oninstruments etc and activism . most of my social media friends were other activists around the world and what i guess you could call online hippies . those types who always post positive shit about growth and love and spiritual progression and all that . i got to the point where , the few friends i had that lived close enough to chill with , absolutely bored me to death when we hung out . all they ' d wanna talk about was tv , other people , partying , they ' d be on their phones all day and couldn ' t hold a conversation between all the selfies and status updates . i wanted to learn , discuss and debate theories , philosophize , do new things , progress at my hobbies , but that bored them , it was all nerd shit . so without anyone in person to do these things with , i really had no reason to leave the house anymore , everything i wanted to do could be done in the comfort of my home , besides skate . but after breaking my foot , and getting olderweak joints , especially my damn knees , i slowed down with skating and focused on other hobbies . i have a few good friends i message and talk to regularly but we don ' t live close enough to hang out . i get my fill of social interaction through those friends because at least we share hobbies and discuss them and share what we ' ve been working on through pictures and videos and such . i really dont trust people in general so i don ' t care to make new friends really . also , i have mental health issues . two forms of severe depressionsevere lack of drive , desire , motivation with plenty of apathy , moderate anxietygeneral distrust in others  motives like everyone and all the time . , moderate ocdi obsessivly and compulsively mentally obsess about what depresses me and gives me anxiety along with other stupid shit that comes with it . and mild ptsdwhich now that i think about it , might be gone honestly . all diagnosed . i have a few failed suicide attempts , i ' ve given up on trying . if i believed in god , i ' d say it wants me here for something but i dunno . if it wasn ' t for my hobbies i ' d just sleep my life away but i ' m basically just wasting time with my hobbies til i die .

15. you ' re not wrong . the hike to get there isn ' t all that easy though takes just under digit hours and covers about 600m in altitude . it was pretty dangerous at times due to the rain , yet you see people walking up there in flipflops . are they the real  life equivalent of someone driving around in winter without snow tyres on their car and putting themselves and others in danger ?
