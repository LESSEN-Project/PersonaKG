1. as a teacher , i have usually had the lower echelon of students in my classes . it is fairly frequent that i ' ll be cussed at , most of the time because i did something the kid didn ' t like . i ' ll just reply with something like , " why thank you john smith , that is the nicest thing anyone has ever called me . i appreciate that compliment , i really like you , too " sometimes it pisses them off more because they don ' t have control over my actions . after all , when cussing out a teacher , they usually expect an explosion from the teacher , which classmates will film to make vines or other social media videos . most kids will usually realize that they aren ' t going to win and just mutter a " fuck you " and then go back to doing something less inappropriate .
