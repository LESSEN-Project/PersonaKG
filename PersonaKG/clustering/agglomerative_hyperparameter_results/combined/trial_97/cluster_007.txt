   (ID: a0295151ec48c51be6978c891260159d3526ed86)

5. the messenger by markus zusak , everyone raves about the book thief , and rightly so i think it ' s fantastic , but imo the messenger is a phenomenal piece of literature . the content it explores are real , hard hitting issues , and the narrative styles he uses are unlike many other authors i ' ve ever read . the just utter cleverness of zusak , the twist he throws in at the end is just unique . after reading this book i had one of those hand  over  mouth  rethinking  every  life  choice  what  the  fuck  did  i  just  read  wow moments . seriously read this book , it ' s fantastic and deconstructing it didn ' t ruin it for me , it helped digit year old me understand it better , and have more of the aforementioned moments .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

10. duuuuuuuude . now seriously  this is impressive for a first release . sure , they ' ve been working on it for some time , but it already has features that are still missing from opera and people are complaining about  digit versions after the abandonment of presto . everything is looking good , it even works on , although a bit sluggish on the machine i ' ll be using for some more months . i noticed it has some gestures , but it seems they are neither documented nor customizable for now  e . g . down  right closes the current tab .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

11. i think it ' s a nice app . new vocab is presented in a way that is easy to learn and backed up by flashcards , pictures and matching . this is the same way i learnt greek . the interface of the app honestly feels cluttered and out of place imho . it ' s a bit laggy as well . i think it would be nice if the app could be designed around the materiel design or a similar flat design . overall , it ' s a good app and i look forward to using it .
