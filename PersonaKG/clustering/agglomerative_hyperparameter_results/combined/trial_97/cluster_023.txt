12. yeah maybe your brother shouldn  t have pets again . this is not a punishable by death offence  unless he  s actually attacked  a bite here and there is not full blown aggression . this is reactionary behaviour . if he asked a trainer to consult , i bet it could be fixed . also , he has kids . i get the worry about having children bitten . if he won  t train the dog , i doubt he  ll train the children not to treat the dog roughly and the dog will react with biting . kids bite people too , until they are taught how not to react , or trained if you will . what does one do with an aggressive kid ? i  m really sad for that doggo . edit  i can  t spell .
