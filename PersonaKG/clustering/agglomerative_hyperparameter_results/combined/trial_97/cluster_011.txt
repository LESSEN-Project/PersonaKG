5. it ' s an american past  time to remove things . it started with the letter " u " from certain words . i can kind of understand this one because it ' s not really needed . sometimes they ' ll just treat letters as silent if they don ' t like them . like the word " solder " in relation to electronics . most americans think it has a silent " l " and pronounce it " sodder " . then they started to remove the word " of " from common use . so you ' ll often hear people say things like " couple friends " , " couple things " , and " couple people " , when it should have been " a couple of " or " a few " . then they started removing the word " to " . so instead of saying " write to your friends " they say " write your friends " . pretty soon the average american ' s grasp of language is going to look like a teenager texting  tweeting .
