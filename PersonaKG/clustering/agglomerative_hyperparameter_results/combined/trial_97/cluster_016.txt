   (ID: b30983a02e6c6ad80a50a521eee441b9f454a5e9)

16. i  m sorry i can  t offer some kind of fix all solution for you . it  s a tragic thing  years later and my mother  s still stuck in her old ways . the only thing you can do for them is try to be supportive . as i learned , though , some people . they really just don  t want to get better . it  s a sad life to live , and it hurts to see , but there truly isn  t much you can do . patience is key , and if they can truly find it in themselves to seek a better life , then they will  it may take days or it may take years . overall , it  s just a question of ,  is it worth it ?  do you truly want to stick around through thick and thin , then the answer is yes . unfortunately , i believe you  re already doing all you can by being a supportive friend . maybe he  s not quite as far gone as my mother was , and a family  friend intervention could at least get the wheels turning ? other than that , i regret to say that i have no advice . best of luck xx

17. hey it  s good you  ve acknowledged you have a problem ! i don  t think disliking your boyfriends watching porn is inherently a crazy thing but the depths to which it  s making you suffer isn  t normal . do you have any trauma or mental illness history ? things of that nature can influence feelings like this . i know you said you  ve tried therapy but i would give it another go , and or make it a requirement that your bf  s don  t watch porn . some men don  t watch it in the first place

20. nta . i used to be that guy myself , looking back , i was a dick . games are never fun when balanced completely against everyone but the one highly  skilled player . and let ' s not forget the main purpose of games is fun . on the part of him bringing it up multiple times it seems he was insecure about himself  the relationship , like why was he trying to make you feel bad about such a small thing ? not cool . as i said , games are for fun , not crushing your friends relentlessly and then wondering why they start playfully ' ganging  up ' against you . just my thoughts anyway
