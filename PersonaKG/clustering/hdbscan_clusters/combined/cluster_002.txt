1. i agree . especially a punisher rear slide plate cover . unfortunately a prosecutor can turn anything around and convince the layperson of wrongdoing . from what you saw with the young guys . officer how many hours do you spend in the gym ? how many hours do you practice with your firearm ? so it is more important for you to be stronger to carry more ammo than to be proficient with your gun ?

   (ID: 99f23e8b04a17c44a1585809230dd7c68fefab16)

8. i agree we are all waluigi , but he would be better off if he didn  t have mario or luigi stealing his spotlight . waluigi is more than capable of being his own man , but he doesn  t . you see the key to his personality is that he stands out so much , and at the same time fits in so well
   (ID: 3fff1b9f2826f67730a90b0826e2ae56278e5d92)

   (ID: 29946670851ecd2e37e207eff8da8574e63e86df)

10. that ' s messed up that the mods harassed you . in my opinion it doesn ' t matter if you liked califronia or hated itim the 2nd one . the i think we all can agree feldman was either in over his head or just flat out sucks . jerry finn is missed by many . he ' s literally a legend in the genre .
   (ID: 6f7a36cd984856f8ca04e3bf61ce29d26835c491)

11. i agree , though bumblebee is a bit more frustrating due to how tough it can be to properly transform him .
   (ID: 718ff22055f41bd70e24ec98f0898a1526112965)

   (ID: 29f3e9a3f8c02fc1b9aa346cffb8edec6caac89f)

   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

16. as a catholic , i can agree that you ' re fucking wrong that ' s not how it works
   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

18. i agree . even fighting should be done with respect . all fists no weapons and no kicking while the other guy is down . kicking someone in the head while they  re down is done pansyass bs . give them a chance to stand and fight like fights should be
   (ID: 0e1406b3a5b6031911de9279cf70144f8f1d9136)

19. ok , yeah , i see what you  re saying , and i agree . still certain players , lebron being one of them , can play wherever and still get those crazy endorsements , so that  s not necessarily a big market advantage .
   (ID: 0adc203530167f27a334f03a3d44b3c302d91f2a)

20. the problem is , the real authentic ones are actually made in china . i agree with the stock image though . unless buying from a proper online shop , i shall not be purchasing from anyone that has a stock image . lesson learnt ! unamused  face
