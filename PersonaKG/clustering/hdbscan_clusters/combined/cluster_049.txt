1. i ' m a bit confused on what your asking but i ' m going to assume your asking can you use your vive without your monitor plugged into your gpu ? if that is what your asking idk about vive but if your pc is on and you use a rift it puts you into a launch screen type thing so if the vive has that then yeah you can .
   (ID: 064b68f55fd83de76c3cbc4f130670e6435e42a4)

2. you ' re suppsoed to release the ble  whatever before you push the plunger down . so tie off  register  release the belt . if you leave the belt on andyou inject more iquid int he vein then the vein is under more pressure . when you release it the blood flow continues and the drugs you inject is carried off with the blood that is pumping through the vein . or don ' t use one if you ' re able to do it withoout , it ' s not a necessary step just a helpful tool . the bruising could be a result of that if you didn ' t release it . what also helps if you bruise easily is to put pressure on the injection site . the alcohol wipe that you use to clean your arm with before iv you can also use to push down onthe site when you are pushing the needle out . this will stop the bleeding faster , so also less blood with leak from your vein causes bruising under your skin . but most important things are to use new needles , don ' t use the same spot too often and pick a different spot to iv so the previous places can heal a bit before you use them again . lave the site witht he trackmarks a lone for a bit , let it heal .

14. a preferred pronoun is a misnomer . replace pronoun with name to see what i ' m getting at . your name , whatever it is , isn ' t your preferred name . it ' s just your name . if i call you something else , that ' s incorrect . a person may use different pronouns and names over time . this is still not about preference but accuracy . you use the word obviously but there is nothing obvious about sex or gender . appearance varies culture to culture , person to person . you have no standing to simplify the matter to this degree . but let ' s say you ' re right . you ' re obviously male and we should use male pronouns to talk about you . a trans person doesn ' t necessarily enjoy your privilege of the obvious gender . so that trans person tells you what pronouns to use . how nice ! so why wouldn ' t you use them ? you are not required to use a certain pronoun . nobody can stop you from being an asshole . you have free will .
