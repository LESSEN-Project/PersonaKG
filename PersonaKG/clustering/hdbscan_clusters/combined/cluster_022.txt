1. a brief look and i am guessing it is real . i can ' t take any more than a brief look as my liver is already in open rebellion and i think exposure to that site would probably prompt a few more organs to join it .
   (ID: 59ebeb8d8fee755bce043a6482743bde8a2a0bb1)

2. i find it more disturbing than he can look through walls and clothes
   (ID: 9a79b05d9254cd2c33add44b7119f844802b48d9)

   (ID: 60767c0b3f4fbb31bad0bee921528b0976287f68)

4. this is a reacurring dream . i wake up and every one is dead then i blink and i ' m outside in a dump . i see my cat and pick him up but then he turn to a pile of bones and blood . when i look at my hands they are full of glass . when i look back up i ' m in a bathroom with my sister but she ' s dead . when i start to remove the glass from my hand its a big piece that is about digit inches . then i hear a bang from upstairs and so i go up with a knife . when i reach the top of the stairs i get pushed down then wake up . its terrifying and i try not to sleep anymore .

   (ID: 5a485308ca6e36eb17d7b0fc321fcf7695f3af53)

   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

8. what ' s it look like when it ' s on ? is it not obvious ?
   (ID: 2ce8587266f0888bb10672ccf8a7be1bc6c3f0d2)

9. no big red flags here . you look attractive from this angle . unless you are hiding something from the waist down that is a deal breaker . this particular pic makes your complexion look very pale , but that ' s not a bad thing , at least in my opinion .
   (ID: 08f11971c665b10afd81008344be824eee9ae6a7)

10. are you referring to that viral image of some kid that doesn ' t even look like him wearing a gag tee from snorg ? the one that glorified bloggers started circulating before the victims were even done bleeding out ?
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

11. what makes you think that i  m intentionally trying to get their attention and being  creepy  ? smiling at someone who makes eye contact with you is polite , not creepy . giving them a dirty look is rude . it seems like automatically giving a stranger a dirty look screams  i  m pathologically insecure  .

19. it is bad in many moments like how the monsters look and that many characters look kinda dollish . what bothered me most were the nipples . the fight scenes still looked great in my opinion and the important characters didn ' t look worse than what you get in your usual anime
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)
