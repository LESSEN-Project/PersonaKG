10. i mean the ai was the one that made the art , so the ai should be credited with the creation of the art and depending on how advanced the ai is would affect wither the ai or yourself would have the rights to the art . like if the robot sophia made a painting i  m pretty sure she  d have the rights to it because she has citizenship in some country . but maybe that  s changed . i  m not a legal expert at all though .
