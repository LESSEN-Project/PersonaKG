1. that sounds like you have some really tense fingers , no idea what would help with that . my best guess would be to pay attention to your hand while you play and see if it gets super tense , and if so relax a bit . otherwise visiting your doctor might help
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

   (ID: fe5860fea6be29c69501e1a97b1240375d594aa9)

3. i did , it was alright . your mileage will definitely vary with how into your partner you are and  or how much you like big parties . if you ' re just going with friends , then i hope you like fancy parties , else you won ' t get much out of it . if you ' re really into the digit  digit  howevermany people you ' re taking as dates though and enjoy romance then yeah it ' s pretty romantic . it ' s not cheap , though , so consider how much a formal dance setting and a fancy dinnerdate appeals to you , because that ' s about all there is to it .
   (ID: 99339abeb32b696e2ac12139001f76ebf63d0868)

6. was showing a couple of my buddies the game yesterday and actually had two great matches , an escape without getting hooked and then all four survivors killed , and both times the post game chat got flooded with toxicity , to the point where one of my friends looked uncomfortable to take a stab at playing the game after i ' m here from overwatch because the toxicity there is disgusting , but sometimes here it gets pretty overbearing too . ' it sure scrapping the chat is the right idea but it would be nice if maybe after enough reports of toxic chat were verified , a player could be like shadow muted ? they think they ' re sending their bm to all players but it ' s not being sent ?
   (ID: 8df56ee782672f11aeb0f19bf7978b1b1c04e678)

   (ID: 06d36f7d62805a0b21c94f31f41e8eccef2b014d)

16. sorcerer was my first choice and i have never looked back . i have tried all digit classes out , but always found myself coming back to my sorcerer . i re  rolled my attributes  skills and race vs leveling a new toon to use stamina instead of magicka after a year of being a magic sorc . i have to say that both magic and stam sorc are very fun and by far my fav class overall . ultimately it will be up to you and your personal preference . your play style will  should dictate what class you play and enjoy . i myself am aggressive and offensive sometimes too much so . i have a mageblade and enjoyed it for a time . sneaking around ganking  picking off the weak ones is fun . i think magic night blade is in a tight spot right now in pvp but things change with every update .

   (ID: cd7d2576afdbdebbe88d5b40a7b4f436af37c202)

18. my start  up lead engineer is shutting down possibly permanently and i literally have nearly failed out of school for the work i do . i was lead on for digit months that things would get better , so i took on more responsibility and happily so until i was literally laying a young girl i hired specifically because i was requested to hire someone digit months prior . it was then i knew i had no real authority , power , or potential . i ' m dragging my self through to find something else while i support my family , but the young girl is back for this week and likely to be laid off again for good this time . i had to do it last time and this time it ' s likely all three of my young staffers so my heart is broken over a job that gave me nothing . in complete honesty the reason this shut down is even happening is related to the sales people who are in charge of the shut down . they sold us fake futures but couldn ' t win a contract worth shit . btw the plant was backed by a large conglomerate and managed by a small entity outside the plant . for reference .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)
