Total from this dataset: 447

1. i used to worry about this , in hospital , with doctors and stuff . you wonder if you will get a tingly wingly but it ' s really not an erotic thing when it actually comes time to lift your gown . truth is doctors don ' t have a fuck to give . there is probably a person in the next room with his dick chopped off . whether you get aroused or not doesn ' t make an ounce of difference to them . don ' t overthink it .

2. whatever you ' re into , your dick is completelty okay . imagine that there are men who are envying whay you have got there .

3. it  s not offensive , never said it was . and again , i  m not against sending a message , it  s how that message is sent . my concern is that they will overdo the strong independent female personality , just for the sake of it , robbing the characters depth and transforming them into a trope . it would be as boring and lifeless as a generic male power fantasy .

4. all of these people here saying you should give it a try or that you ' re being a dick are wrong . if you aren ' t comfortable with it , that isn ' t bad , it doesn ' t make you a shit person . straight up , being a furry is weird . it really is . it ' s someone dressing up as an animal in weird cartoon like suits , most often for a sexual purpose . people dressing up in animal costumes for sex is not normal , and is likely certainly a mental issue . i mean no offense to your gf , but really . don ' t do anything you aren ' t comfortable with . don ' t indulge in this bc if you do it ' ll make you crazy . literally . i mean like it ' ll cause you to go crazy  in case the meaning was unclear also , i think you may need to seriously think about breaking up with her . i know that ' s not a desirable outcome , and that you love her , but i think that truly is something that is digit  a deal breaker in a relationship . unless you can think of some way you both can be satisfied perhaps open the relationship ? i know that ' s mostly never desirable for a lot of ppl but idk it could help if you just wanna stay with her . i have a problem in my relationship issue in the same vein , not specifically about being a furry but still a fetish thing which has some parts i ' m not entirely comfortable with . i am trying to find a way to deal with that myself . it is incredibly hard even in a partial , lesser way . i ' m sorry , i can ' t imagine how you feel .

5. well if you find those nasty meth  head pictures of women hot i guess very ?

6. by the simplest and most accurate definition , it ' s a particular act that you personally sexualise more than just about anything else . it doesn ' t have to be innately sexual . just like sexualities and , closer in relation , fetishes , nobody knows why fantasies exist . but there is speculation that the reason they remain fantasies is because people rarely see themselves participating in real life .

7. i ' ve personally faced violence for being a transman more than once , and i live in a really bigoted place filled with truly awful people . i totally get where you ' re coming from  the point of my comment was actually to point of that transmen face their share of issues with being trans . most commonly , in my experience , misogyny that reduces us down to genitals and the use that men can have for them .

8. it ' s my fucking shower , if you find it gross how i decide to wash my body you are free to not shower here . and i use a loofah not a wash cloth .
   (ID: bd723644638296cdfc92c932fca8a0e0d4cc9f7f)

9. i only experience a split stream if i don ' t pee immediately after ejaculating . i usually get an urge to pee within five minutes after sex or masturbating . i hold it for a while before going , it will do the same thing that you described . i started sitting down to pee while at home around six months ago and a lot of my problems have been resolved . i ' ve found that in the sitting position , urine is able to exit the urethra better and i don ' t need to shake or pump out any remaining liquid when i ' m done . i still use a public urinal when it ' s available , except when i ' m at work because it takes more time and my boss qualifies for a stupid loophole in the state break law .

10. go to a bar and purposely anger all the guys there like that scene in family guy

11. to be fair i kind of find it interesting . being a straight furry is like being gay in the world . we ' re made fun of , some people ignore us very small minority , but still , and its very difficult to find people you can relate to . so you won ' t find solice here . it ' s the world upside down and its sometimes fun to see what would the world be with lgbt being the majority . i know it can sometimes suck , but hey , being a furry is a choice unlike race or in some cases , arguably , your attraction . you have to put up with all the bullshit , but you can quit at any time .

12. quality , man . you gotta see that cooch at 1080p without any pixelation . otherwise you feel like you are watching asian porn all the time .

13. i think it ' s more that it was adopted by some people as a symbol of white supremacy , so now anyone making that symbol could potentially be using it to mean that rather than just a generic hand gesture

14. i was just thinking about this today ! i am a feminist through and through , went to a local resist rally stoked , even went with my boyfriend . it was not empowering nor have hopes to ignite feminism and create allies . speakers were talking about punching men in the face and laughing about it , about taking our rightful place above men . i was disgusted , sure self defense , take care of yourself , but breaking a guys nose because he disagrees does not look good for feminism nor does it inspire more men to be stronger allies . i don  t understand this reasoning , it doesn  t empower women , it shamed them .

15. yeah , but the largest reason for wet dreams is that your body has produced more semen than it needs , it then has to get rid of the old semen by disposing of it . sending it through to the penis

16. in the previous week we talked about dreams and falling teeth is not something good as far as i remember . go check it out mate .

17. they don ' t , but in the modern world if you oppose corporate greed and unsustainable growth you get the far left label thrown at you no matter what your actual views on the economy are .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

18. thank you for the reassuring words . you think abstinence is a good idea ? won ' t i orgasm too soon if i keep hard anyways ?
   (ID: 7ba2f45f62c701a508f1895df828d4da2f3f446d)

19. why is it hilarious ? that ' s the crux of this whole thing , dude . why are you happy to offend people ? also , i told you already , you can wear it all you want , but you ' re gonna have to deal with the consequences . i think it ' s a symbol of racism , bigotry , and classism . there ' s nothing good about it , and i get to be critical . it ' s kinda my fucking birthright in this country
   (ID: cca2db8a0bcb7aff323abdba1f381d7388c9f713)

20. always a pleasure ! just tell people it happens cause of sex and it  ll be fine . might even fix it .
