3. and i  m trying to tell you that those statistics involve single shootings that involve gang activity . i don  t know how much more clear i can make it . the class president doesn  t have a digit  chance of getting shot at school . gary gangbanger does . you  re trying to push a gun control narrative you saw on msnbc or whatever msm trash outlet you watch . if you honesty think your white bread , middle of the road kid has a digit  chance of being killed at school by a bullet , then congratulations you  ve bought into skewed statistics and fear mongering .

7. when they riot they also block ambulances from tending to the wounded . this is assuming the worker was black which is a fair assumption .

8. when you place a regular phone call , your phone will attempt to establish a connection to the network the sim card is registered to assuming gsm . if this is not possible , the call will not go through . likewise , if you do not have a sim card in the phone , or it ' s been deactivated , the call will not go through . however , when you place a call to an emergency number e . g digit , digit , digit , digit etc . , your phone will compare the number being dialled to a list of emergency numbers , and if it ' s recognised as an emergency number , your phone will establish a connection with the strongest network and place the call .

10. empty coke cans taped around my head for halloween . i was a coke head .

11. sign it up with superrewards and their network of advertisers so that even at 3am they ' ll get cold calls from numbers that are bogus or whose caller id appears as " not available . even better if the mark is already paranoid , they might think the man is keeping tabs on them .
   (ID: dc123ff47fa4f2e85bbecd444342fe7d8fcb7db5)

12. yep never had any friends , gf , or known anybody outside of my parents and pretty sure they wouldn ' t kill me , so given that nobody even knows i am alive now pretty sure safe . and yeah the current psychopathic orange moron would be dead and life would be better .

13. i think it ' s gotten worse recently . police will always harass you until you give them money . lots of shady businesses that are obviously run by cartels and shit . also depends on where you go . i sure as hell will never step foot in juarez . but long as you don ' t do anything stupid then you ' ll be ok .

14. of course i don ' t fucking think that . i ' m just trying to point out that the whole " he could ' ve just got an illegal gun on the black  market " argument is bullshit . if in the future there is a gang driven black  market for semi  autos in nz the gangs will need to be very careful about who they sell them too , and a some neck beard 4chan weirdo would almost certainly be told to fuck off .

15. i wish i didn  t find your account , your post history is fucking mental . it  s literally like some true detective serial killer shit . you need to get out before its too late .
   (ID: c06f82a9d6f502a9c5707645e6b0bc869ff37975)

16. jaywalking , such shame
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

17. no there are plenty of checks in place . you know most serial killers never break any other laws and are otherwise normal people right ? every legal gun owner has to go through a background check .

18. did you feel like you were treated differently in jail because of the combination of your age and it being the first time you were there ? like , were you treated like a responsible person who just messed up ?

19. he ' s already destroyed three lives me , my sister and my mom . don ' t let him destroy yours too . i appreciate the sentiment though .
   (ID: 0e56d8a3bf928d2e85ff5b7a5a98f913d2826b00)

20. i don ' t know what kind of eye corrections he had done but when i had mine done i needed full wrap glasses that were technically out of regs they came with a lanyard so i still was able to do pt and normal day to day activities . depending on what was done you could end up doing irreparable damage to his eyesight . dick for not informing anyone and placed himself at risk but if he has a profile he ' s got a profile not much you can do . could nc him technically for not keeping everyone in the loop but that would just be reaching imo .
