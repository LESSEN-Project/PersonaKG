10. " the reason you can ' t put effort into anything is because you ' re scared of being disappointed when you do learn your own ' size ' . but it ' s okay to be disappointed . once you know your own size , you ' ll finally know what you should do . and once your understand yourself , what you want to do gradually comes into focus "  digit gatsu no lion . dare to learn and courage , courage to know yourself . we subconsciously avoid things that may damage our identity or conception . but sometimes , it ' s good to delve into that and learn your weakness . knowing your limits signals room for your growth . tells you the parameters of your game , and helps you form controls for your experiment . but , if you are afraid , remember  your limits can be your principles as well . it ' s all a matter of interpretation , but you must dare to attempt learning about yourself .

12. memorization in university  ? do you mean you cannot have whatever books you wish in tests there  ? if so , it ' s totally useless  most assumptions of world  space  materials will be old and unusable after , say , digit years , so wide area on  how  to find stuff in books allowed everywhere is important , memorization has very little to do , only that you know what part of book to use and then home on it on each test . please tell me it was a grammatical error they make you memorize something in university ! because you memorize the important stuff automatically when you get to work and you don ' t know what work yet when you ' re in university .
   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

17. when people touch your stuff . it happens too often that people just pick up my backpack and throw it on my lab instead of asking to free the seat next to me . and for some reason its always women who do that , guys always ask
   (ID: ed7b237fb6485952b3dcc1d753d52f12dfff995a)

18. i  m sober too and sometimes say politely  i  m sober  when someone offers me a drink and i  m trying to head off or end a conversation about why i don  t want a drink  prevent a future offer . sometimes people don  t take  no thank you , i don  t drink .  as a full answer without follow up questions which i may not be opening to answering . i  ve had many first dates where i  ve had to say i  m a recovering alcoholic to get people to stop questioning me about why i don  t drink . for the record i  m not saying op was going to question her thusly or that the coworker was polite , but , just that  i  m sober  can have a more valid , less self righteous context versus a simple  no , thank you .  .

19. not so terrible but , in shared living spaces , people drunk  high moving my cooking food off the oven so they can use it . here i am in another room chilling , waiting eagerly for my food to cook , go back out digit mins later and my food ' s been moved to an off hotplate , while some prick stands there with their food on the on hotplate . cunt , i was using that !

20. due to a motorcycle accident , i have a huge scar across my head i was wearing a helmet . i was really self conscious about it and it stopped me from interacting with others . you have to just say fuck it and put yourself out there and let the person you ' re interested in make their decision . don ' t try to cover it up and just let the world see it . there is no way you will be concerned with it digit  of the day every day and pretty soon you will come home and realize you didn ' t even think about it all day . that will be the end of it .
