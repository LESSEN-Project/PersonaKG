10. how the hell is a thin cloth supposed to save you from oc spray and tear gas ? like i ain ' t trying to take sides here , but this argument is dumb , do you genuinely believe that will work ? these kids cover their faces out of the sheer edginess of larping as revolutionaries in the street , like antifa and the like , let ' s not bullshit ourselves here .

11. my busdriver used to make me walk a mile to my stop because it saved him two minutes on his loop . we always got to school with plenty of time to spare . parents today need to let their kids grow up a bit . it ' s not dangerous for them to walk out of site of your home . there aren ' t predators lurking on every corner waiting to steal your kids .

16. exactly , you ' re not here to entertain me , but this post was meant to entertain whether or not it ' s for easy karma is a different matter . this is the first time i saw this , and judging from all the up doots , i ' d say i ' m not the only one . nothing is original because someone is always going to say it first , all that matters is how and when you do it .
