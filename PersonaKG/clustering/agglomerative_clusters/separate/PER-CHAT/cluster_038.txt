9. people who use daetta are almost exclusively grad students or british . the former using it to think they  ve reached a point in life where it means anything other than a bunch of crude information that they  ll have to sort through into something meaningful in less than digit years . the latter being a speaker of a dialect that  s functionally lost everything but its ability to be snobs .

10. maybe his friends are just used to mockicking him and they do it rather jokingly . that ' s kind of insult  based friendship  relationship , commonly occur in real life . hiccup allows that because he is fine with it . if it comes to the villain , why wouldn ' t he try to insult him ? his aim was tomake hiccup lose his nerves , start acting impulsively and be easier to defeat . of course the more accurate and touchy the insult is , the better are the results but maybe grimmel couldn ' t come out with anything better as he never met hiccup in his live so he just reffered to his appearance . after all he ' s tights aren ' t very thicc .

13. i was asked a question i wasn ' t ready for and had to spend a solid minute or digit thinking of a response in silence . i ' ve been told that kind of thing makes you look good in a way because you actually considered your answer instead of just spouting some bullshit but i don ' t know if i believe that

14. love saying  yeet . mostly cause you can just emphasize different parts of the word , plus i ' m just a loud boy  o so it does me good . hate  the word ' hate ' in all honesty . too hurtful of a word , i just say strongly dislike or was mediocre . hate is such a strong word towards some things people just dislike .
