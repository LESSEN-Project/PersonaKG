6. kinda late to the party but i remember that life was miserable as hell for me throughout prep school . i borrowed this pencil sharpener from some girl in my 2nd year and i some how misplaced it . overwhelmed with guilt i went and apologised and offered to buy a new one or replace it but she just wouldn ' t have it . she told me that her mom loved that sharpener and i was going to be in big trouble so i basically was in debt to her for the rest of my life . everyday i got to school i had to give her my snacks and even had to buy her lunch on most days . if that wasn ' t bad enough she got her older sister that was a grown ass teenager in on it , she would literally look for me during lunch hours like some pimp coming in to collect . they made me feel so bad because i felt like i committed some unforgivable act . basically i was their personal piggy bank for a couple years . fuck you guys and it makes me wonder how the hell could a 2nd year student be so manipulative .

" and got to work on something that was meant for my brother , but he was way more deserving . so , i gave him a taste of his own medicine , brought a carton of eggs to school , and then dumped them on him on his way out of school mind you , the school had multiple floors ! every single one fell on him . i didn ' t even fell bad at the time , until my friends told me he had a crush on me . yeah , bad decision . got suspended , but my parents understood . now he hates me .
