3. apparently " triggered my trap card " comes from the yu  gi  oh show thing that was popular back in middle school that means , from what i understand , is that the other person is getting " owned " because they set off a reaction of events that works against themselves . so i dont really understand this statement as i ' ve never watched yu  gi  oh but how i interpret the ops statement is that " if you sleep with a girl that used to be a guy then you ' ve given them the upper hand and got owned by them by validating their femininity " . or something like that . i ' m not saying i agree with them , i ' m just saying i think thats what they mean .

4. then i guess it ' s not gonna happen at all which is okay too . don ' t ruin your work environment . those are some bridges that shouldn ' t be burned . you can control your emotions . only you chose what you think and feel for a person .

5. because as much as i detest a lot of the things republicans say and do , nobody can be as obnoxious as a full  bore democrats .

7. it ' s not hate it ' s self  satisfaction . they know something you don ' t and enjoy reminding you of it . the irritation is manufactured to cover up the narcissism .

8. when you feel like you are living with a roommate versus someone you are in love with .
   (ID: 13773c5692e9c83c78b055c57cb682df4ef2654b)

9. when you see a no soliciting sign , that is the easiest sale of the day , the reason they put those signs there , they know that they are suckers and will buy anything . remember pma equals opm , it means positive mental attitude equals other people ' s money .

10. that ' s horrible ! law should protect people no matter what , not allowing to hurt them legally . i ' m from poland . my physics teacher is roasting and disrespecting whole lgbt  and other minorities all the time . he ' d better teach us physics but noooo . he ' s been teaching in this school for years and it seems nobody ever complained about him to the headteachers , or they did but it had no effect . i guess there are multiple teachers like him here . even wort ones

11. " i ' ll let you touch my  insert private area here  "
   (ID: 19b7c5d60c447b44c31c1aea0c3cbc7f347bf8bb)

12. if it were that bad , id just say it outright , but then again  im working as a part time cashier so me losing my job is less of a big deal lol . i doubt youd lose your job for that though .
   (ID: dd1a306ab5abb82ade20a2c7f74d928797a35a61)

13. " would you do me ? i would do me "
   (ID: aaee7c28c6f1f83a427cf3dccf635bb78656a19d)

14. that ' s not really my point you brick . if they don ' t want to work over their contract required hours , they don ' t have to . yes sitting is easy , we can all do it , but some of us do more than that , and want more than that , people deserve days off . if you want to go in and fix it , than be our guest but something tells me your screen , which you claim to sit by everyday , is a little too simple to do the work .
   (ID: c6e9d7bec5bbee67d384191c91101e443de5ac3c)

15. have you ever been to a party ? it ' s common to film someone in those .
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

16. don  t go into a relationship with the mindset that you will change the other person , aka don  t fall in love with the person you think they can be . if someone says that they rather be friends with you than date you and you say yes to being friends , you can  t think that they will eventually fall in love with you or that you will be able to win them over . this one might seem obvious to you but i think we have all seen this happen .

17. former hotel manager here . this for sure ! managers are held under such high scrutiny in this industry and can be seen as relatively disposable . a positive review for a manager that had to give a service recovery could go a long way for them . also , as a gold member , the hhonors desk is your best friend . they will often go to bat for you should you have issues in the future .

18. i have a baito as a housekeeper in houses in kyoto how , how do they want me to clean windows effectively with sponge towels and water ? what the flying hell also , i get that were paid by the hour but sato  san , can you stop spending an hour making a freaking bed while i clean half the house and then say      not it  s not me who is   it  s you who is bloody
   (ID: 272bbd1e0746915faf3405ae9c33485b5967ca9f)

19. i don ' t think i ' ve ever known anyone ever admit to being a jerk to other people . that would actually be quite refreshing .
   (ID: 204bc9dfdfd5ae40abfe0643025c3f61abea8ee1)

20. doesn ' t the money you pay for the clothes go to charity anyway ? so it ' s not like you did anything wrong shopping there when you could afford some other place .
