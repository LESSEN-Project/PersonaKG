1. at the risk of getting excommunicated from this sub , i ' m going to agree with you . while i respect the massive influence ce has had on the series and gaming in general , i don ' t think it ' s aged too well . a lot of this missions are really repetitive , to the point of being boring imo . there ' s a lot to love , obviously music and atmosphere being obvious choices , but i don ' t find it nearly as fun or engaging as the others in the series .

2. pick a job that will be relevant digit years from now like law or construction .

3. well best of luck and be yourself personally i would never jump into politics tho . wanted to be a lawyer or something in the criminal justice but aye i was raised around some  illegal  shit and i just said it  s not worth my time fighting for lost cause . politics is a circle jerk  gridlock and end of the day nothing is gonna change . just remember this , get a job that can support you and your future family if you want one .

4. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?

5. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .

6. warframe , but it  s not that beginner friendly , so you properly have to see some youtube videos about it

7. i ' ve heard it helps to start cleaning up something small , and then grow from that . even if it ' s just putting a fork into a drawer , it ' s important to start somewhere .

8. tbh there are a lot of 2d games that are better than hzd , such as super mario bros digit and digit . i ' m not saying this game doesn ' t have its niche fanbase that will replay it people such as yourself , i ' m saying it wont be the sort of timeless game that continues getting new players into it years and years after release . it will instead fade into obscurity . the reason it wont age well is , as i mentioned , the fact that it ' s a copied and pasted open world format in an already overrsaturated genre . and it ' s boring .

9. i know you didn ' t ask for advice , but why not learn some programming language since you ' ve got the time to burn . build up some skills , you know ?

10. uh , pick berries or punch wild animals ? like how little technology are we talking lol what can we even do with our lives

11. don ' t waste time  it ' s so precious ! and by the way , i ' m absolutely not saying every moment should be productive or that you should even try to be productive all the time . but try to be a bit accountable for what you did with your free time . did you watch a new movie ? have a good time with a friend ? make something , write something ? too many times as a teenager someone would ask me " what did you do after school yesterday ? " and i just had nothing to tell them . i was a vegetable , i didn ' t do anything meaningful at all . it ' s inevitable , sometimes you get tired or stressed and you take some time to do nothing at all . but every year my to  do list gets bigger and i have less time to waste . rather than asking what you should want to accomplish , take a moment to think about what matters to you  whatever that is  the people you want to get to know better , the places you want to go , the movies you want to watch , the things you want to learn . why not do those things when you have the time ?

12. hero labs has all of the encounters pre built for 25ish dollars i think . it really save a lot of time in prep . roll20 has all the maps , lightning , characters ect . i didn ' t use the product , but if i were to do it again i would use this .

13. ask yourself what you absolutely love doing , what your values are , what your unique strengths are and what kind of life would you lead if money wasn ' t an issue .

14. you seem to have your head on straight , you want to create something of your own , really embrace your parents ' legacy . if you really feel like its the right move and you ' re excited about it than no one can stop you . however , be prepared for long nights of your own , be prepared that if you do meet a woman and you do have kids that you might put them in the same situation you are in . now thats also an exaggeration , you could completely re invent the company to where you dont even have to lift a finger and youre home with your family all the time . but that will take a very long time . its all your personal preference man , dont completely rule out a college experience and a chance to take on a different path because you might hate working digit  digit in a factory with loud machines all day . whatever you choose to do , just make sure you ' re happy and keep your options open

15. please don ' t do this or consider it . life i has more than what pre adulthood has to offer . your questioning of the world at a young age shows great wisdom . i do not mean this in a bad way , but the world kinda isn ' t real , at least not in the material sense . its not just a ball of gas with us random creatures on it . it is that , but it is also a space where our energetic spirits and souls gets to live in a physical body and interact with other physical bodies . everyone plays the same game every morning , at least in what our souls will allow . we may not be able to choose our material things completely but in every moment , inside our brains and souls we have a choice over how we fe in the moment . you may be an earth angel . they often question whether they feel totally at home on this plant , like home is actually far away . they often feel uncomfortable in social situations . especially because they are aware of the energy they are putting onto other people , which most people are not used to so they shy away but in actual truth its you that has the strong energy and that is what they feel . there is much more , they are often diagnosed with behaviour problems at a young age , they often feel some greater purpose calls them . maybe you might not live a super fantastic material life , but your soul path may be to help others . help others in your situation , study the spiritual arts . i do this for a living , and i can feel that you know you have a deeper side that you feel no one can relate to . it ' s not true , it ' s just that you haven ' t found other like minded people . practical advice  exercise , good diet , reading books , being in nature . don ' t do it man , who knows what your life will be like tomorrow , next week , in a year ' s time , in digit years time . your not permanently doomed because your state of mind is how it is right now . xxxx

16. my laptop is very capable of gaming i run many new games at 1080p 60fps or above reliably and some at the max settings like rainbow six siege . recently i  ve been hitting 80fps  in pubg as well so i don  t know where you got that from . and many youtubers are sources say it  s a great gaming laptop for the price

17. erm . i feel like this is really really weird . i mean , yay for self  improvement . it ' s never bad to focus on improving yourself , even if you are just fine as you are . but i feel like the accent thing is kind of stupid , just because you have an exotic accent doesn ' t mean you ' re any better or worse than you would be without it . it sounds like you have genuinely improved yourself , but the accent thing i believe was just a dumb idea . if you can , try to see if you can drop it very very slowly , and just pass it off as the people around you rubbing off on you and the accent slowly fading . i feel like that ' s the only thing i can imagine going semi  decently .

18. why do you hate fun ?

19. dishes is the most straightforward one , few people talk to youunless you need to wash something , zero experience needed , and if you dont know how to wash dishes .

20. i was in a very similar place . i quit playing about a year ago because i screwed up my game and didn ' t have a backup save . i had 1900ish hours in and was very proficient . recently i ' ve got the itch again and installed to my computer . i downloaded a few mods that i enjoyed last time and loaded up . i started with a science only game but am thinking about switching to career mode .
