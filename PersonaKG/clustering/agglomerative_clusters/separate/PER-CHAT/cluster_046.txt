1. digit is the legal drinking age for most provinces of canada . digit is the celebrated milestone , but so is digit because the states is right below us . for me , kissing draws the big distinction on what would transpire between myself and my . er . partner . take white . i had major major feelings for him and i told him so after kissing him . his response ? word for word  " don ' t say that " . i ' m trying to understand how some people can just walk into a club  bawhatever purely for the intent of sex and they don ' t care who with . maybe i ' m just super picky , i dunno .

2. you should be scared of love , when you love someone you bring down all of your walls and let them in completely . that doesn ' t mean anything bad with happen , though

3. no way , and i don ' t recommend anybody to date someone who has a carbon copy of their personality . i ' d prefer someone that is a good balance for my weaknesses for instance i have a useless sense of direction and can be stubborn often . i want to date someone who will make me a better person , not who is a mirror of myself .

4. sometimes it ' s not a matter of preferring one person over another . you may love your so , but get no sex from them . you don ' t want to break up , but need sex , obviously . so you find someone else you like . not love , but just like . like enough to have sex with . you don ' t find that person preferable to your so on the whole  just for what you can ' t get from them .

6. sure it would be creepy if the guys were random strangers . but op hasn ' t specified that . it could just be people she knows . in view that , i think it ' s alright . quick to jump to conclusions aren ' t we !

7. if someone likes you , they ' ll be embarrassed and look away the second you see them staring . if someone despises you , they most likely dont give a rip if you see them or not .

9. maybe the commenter thinks you ' re implying there ' s more than one girl you ' re dating . which , if so , more power to you as long as all parties are aware and consenting .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

10. your morality is literally do what thou wilt . no , secular morality is based on empathy and logic . it is demonstrable it results in the maximum amount of happiness and the minimum amount of suffering . you are suggesting morality based on self  interest alone .     you may not know , but there is a growing religion that espouses what you claim as rationale a religion espouses a morality system inferior to secular morality ? surprise , surprise . who would have thought huh ?  perhaps you think yourself immune to theological and ideological dangers , but if you ' re under digit years old i would be surprised if that ' s true . i ' m not denying a fucking religion can be harmful to society and cause increasing harm as they grow . but skull  fucking is not a religion . it ' s a behavior . as a behavior we can define under what conditions it is ok . for example , the behavior may be " touching a girl ' s breasts " . we wouldn ' t say , " that ' s immoral " unless the specific conditions were present such as the girl being underage or the touch being without permission . it ' s the same thing for corpse  fucking .  go and fuck the carcase of any animal and see how you feel . just try it . are you now implying that things you don ' t enjoy doing are immoral to do ?  go and fuck the carcase of any animal and see how you feel . just try it . then we can talk . take a slab of meat out of the fridge , let it rot for a day and then rub your dick on it . i literally can ' t do that . if i aquire one , it probably means i got so mad at my ex  husband i finally went and cut the little guy off . in which case , what you describe sounds fun .  see if that ' s the optimal mode of your existence . experience it . what do you mean by optimal mode of your existence . what property is optimized ? and are you saying anything that isn ' t the " optimal mode of your existence " is immoral ? like watching a reality show , is that immoral or the optimal mode of your existence ?

   (ID: 20704d953f0b1774a4782d2f049f69736ac4eea2)

15. something that always gets me is i ' ve tried talking about this to friends . their typical response is " you sleep with lots of girls ! any guy would want that " these are usually friends that are in relationships . they don ' t know just how envious i am of their situation and they don ' t seem to want to understand .
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

16. i think it ' s just you . there seems to be a lot of people around here who want to " fuck the steelers " . they must like them a lot if they want to have sexy time with them . oh , yeah .  s
   (ID: 4ce6edbd86b6936a31b902056e0708d563c2b4bb)

17. granted . you tell the people of the future that you are still hoping to lose your virginity . in your hopes that you ' ll lose your virginity once and for all , they send you to have sex with a robot .
   (ID: 4917a362688355621979e016028f58dbf7f3ac7e)

18. that would bug me too . but at the same time , if you don  t want to have sex , you don  t have too

19. who on this earth has the right to tell you no .
   (ID: 11d16c1ced94665eed03bc34f590f8fafeed40d2)

20. i think it ' s more of a confidence issue for me . if he makes the first move than i know that he likes  wants me rather than me taking the chance and getting rejected . although i have asked out all of my past boyfriends so i don ' t require it .
