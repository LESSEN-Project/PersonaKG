1. sure . in my mind they  re nearly the same thing though . let  s take downs syndrome for example . i believe denmark is basically aborting digit  of their babies with downs . and these people certainly experience life differently than someone without downs . but many of them are also very happy . i hope you don  t feel i  m being argumentative , but another way to approach this topic would be asking  people with disabilities  serious illnesses , do you wish you were never born ?  i think plenty would say absolutely not . if an adult decides not to procreate , that  s their choice . but i don  t want the government telling me i cannot have a child for any reason . especially because they believe it wouldn  t be  good enough .  just my thoughts ! cheers .

2. if god dosent like to see us suffer then why does he let us suffer ? i was raised in church but once i got older i realized it wasn  t for me . i know the whole it  s part of god  s plan story but what about starving children or kids being molested ? how could that ever be part of a god  s plan ? i mean no disrespect i  m just voicing my thoughts .

3. because as like everything else we don  t believe in hear say bullshit . if we believed every bullshit story someone from the past wrote down we would still be worshiping cats and cutting off virgins clits . so from all of us to your god i say this  all it takes is a two minute appearance and boom , we  ll all believe  .

4. you  re right they aren  t the same thing at all , of course they wouldn  t come back the same . like religious texts are treated as truths , many people disagree and tweak them . same thing has happened in history texts , you can  t be digit  certain that it happened in the past . someone may have messed with the records . what separates history and religion is the faith you must have to believe in it .

5. anything else ? you are just going to follow me to every thread i go to ? man , you are insane , like dirty muslims .

6. if they keep that shit to themselves then fine . once they start to verbalize their bigotry then they should understand that whilst they might be free to speak , they are not free from any repercussions .

7. its not moral to believe that the fall justifies all the bad stuff , it just caused it to happen or was the kickstart i suppose . i do believe that adam was made from dust and eve the rib . the snake , in my view , was satan in the form of a snake , or talking through a snake . i read the bible in a metaphorical way . of course many things are taken literally like the earth flooded folks who arent christians , thats their choice . i would never say  go burn in hell  to anyone regardless of age , beliefs , or gender . many good things come from all corners of the world too . there is a misunderstanding between atheists and christians though .

8. may i ask what exactly do you believe in so i can procces how different it is from my speculations or any other of religious people . what exactly do you believe or care to believe as an agnostic atheist ?
   (ID: 10d0b3cd3f9e3f2b4c3fd6c4c8bae3ba7917a344)

9. i agree . you can believe in whatever you want to as long as it isn ' t hurting it abusing anyone .

11. think long and and about the history of black and white people in this country . now tell me . why do you think it ' s not considered racist ?
   (ID: 8784cd4227a610d9cbb51480d635b44be1d31e8c)

12. i think the best option would be to email the professor and just let him know that you don ' t think white privilege is real so you could not write a paper on how to combat it . ask if you could instead write a paper explaining your stance on the topic instead . if you decide to go this route check out steven crowder on youtube . he does the " white privilege doesn ' t exist  prove me wrong " videos . he does a really good job about citing is sources during his discussions . it also gives you an opportunity to see what the other side of this discussion sees  feels .   x200b  if talking to the professor doesn ' t work out i would email the department head or your adviser instead of just talking to them if you have concerns about racism in the classroom . if the situation escalates for some reason then you will want it documented that you have racism concerns . i wouldn ' t necessarily call the professor out for being racist , but i would say that the topic is distasteful since you don ' t agree with the topic because of your personal experiences . maybe somebody else has another opinion on how to handle this because it can get dicey pretty quick .

15. our government killed jfk for his progressive thinking . i think there were several government backed assassinations during those years .
