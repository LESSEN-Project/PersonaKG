1. tupac . although highly controversial his goal was to empower the youth that could relate to his music . although he had controversial hit songs and an even more controversial lifestyle his ultimate aim was to better those that grew up in a similar situation that he did . although he was far from being a perfect role model , if he was allowed to mature he could have been a generations martin luther king , now that might sound like a bold claim but he had millions of adoring fans that hung on his every word . if you youtube some of his speeches , he was a fantastic speaker for his age . when he died he was at a crossroads in his life from being a ' gangsta ' to being a ' revolutionist ' we ' ll never know what could have been but at the age of digit he had a lot of power , whether if you think that was for right of wrong , correctly channeled he had the capability to make a change . edit  regardless of your political stance or background , imagine you are young and feeling hopeless be that of your race or background and your idol speaks to you like this . in my opinion the factory produced artists we see today do not resonate with their fans the way tupac could .
