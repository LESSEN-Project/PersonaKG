2. learn how to joke and also learn that you are not the uk fanbase universe . plenty of friends down the road from me right now and we had a few that were all out of sorts with how the game went last night . i obviously don ' t think the season is over , was just playing up the fact that some of the fans i know were flipping out unnecessarily .

3. but you ' re expecting the outcome of making fire and trying to achieve it . if you had no concept of what it was or where it came from , why would you believe you could make it , or try to ? you know it can be made by friction and other sources . they apparently only know it comes from lightening . and they can ' t make that , so they have no reason to try rubbing sticks together .

14. that day wasn  t really that bad . the day where everything went wrong . i was just and average person  well above average . having the ability to change certain aspects of your personality based on what you eat is definitely not normal . yes , that day was okay . i  ve never eaten that much food in my life . i ran out of things to eat . i started to think about doing things i never should  ve thought of doing . that guy walking down the street looked happy . he looked like he was having a good day . boy did that change . it was an impulse . a gut reaction . i guess after eating all that food i became a hungry slob . i became what i ate . that man seemed so innocent . it  s not my fault i killed him . it  s not my fault he tasted so good . but now i  m going crazy . i can  t get enough . who  s next ?
   (ID: 5042e4f4cf4f00f86836211d30b97922c92f0b46)

15. i am awake , and i didn  t say it was actually optimized . i said it  s  hard  to optimize because of what they have ingame . also assuming someone has some syndrome isn  t so smart .
   (ID: 7fcbabb8b5590a9f0879c20f0dc6ce0b503615d3)

16. i digit  agree with your statement about people who are new to recovery low key bragging about their use . when i was in rehab there was always a group of sprouts sitting around trying to outdo each other with stories of how hard they supposedly were . i ' m not sure if they were trying to prove something or romanticising something they could no longer have now they are in recovery  i know how easy it is to become preoccupied with living in the past and sharing stories of the " good old days " when you know those " good old days " are no more . kind of a coping mechanism , however there was definitely a stench of one  upmanship lingering whenever the topic of drug use came up which was often as it was the reason everyone was there in the first place tldr  drug addicts like to talk about drugs

   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

19. they work all the time . as for why . because the human body is extremely susceptible to suggestion .
   (ID: 800762ac8d54632109094a4e9132fe0aed711561)

20. that ' s exactly what ' s happening . they believe it ' s a phase that everyone goes through and one just has to suck it up . they don ' t realize that it ' s very tough for some people while manageable for others .
