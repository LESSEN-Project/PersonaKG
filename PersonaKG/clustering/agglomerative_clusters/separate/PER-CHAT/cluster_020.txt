3. love is a crazy thing , it ' s really hard for other people to give insight . don ' t let yourself be walked all over and remember that just because someone has bad experiences does not excuse bad behaviour . be careful

4. if you  re four months into the relationship , i think they  d be happy to hear  i love you .  that  s just me and my partner , though . best way to do it is  hey , person  s name ? they respond  yeah  or  what  etc i love you .

   (ID: 0dd32da9f7e822909c258818ed313736b958a15a)

8. male im not really friends with any girls , but i do know that a ton of stuff i say is a joke , and even sometimes ill give actual advice in a half joking way , its weird . something like " how about you dont please " cant think of any off the top of my head and also , yes , i hear tons of fucked up things but dont really get offended at any of it , confirming your point . . waait so are girls really that boring ?
   (ID: 8eba9c7d48a60bfbded2227dacd3275ae756fcce)

9. i ' m a guy . considered pretty i guess . i don ' t do anything to make me look better or make anyone like me better . fuck that , i have better things to do and i have no  one else to please but me . my gf knows this and she hates it . i understand it can be different for females cause mostly other girls are judging you based on effort and actual looks and not sure create a picking order based on it . how come girls care so much about other girls ? have any of you ever realized that we guys really do not care what color your nails are ? or how your mascara has been done ?
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

10. i would really like for this girl at my university to be interested in me
   (ID: f296ca909e75f5e7a28f054f4937f3c6eccb6a56)

11. the best question to ask is " how are you " and really mean it and be interested in what the other person has to say . everyone is always so caught up in our own little dramas we hardly see how anyone around us is really doing . it makes people feel good to know you care , too .
   (ID: ca01778748155fdbafe1e5147834524488f521c5)

12. you seriously want a bad boy ? how about a good man ? they are much better .
   (ID: 13773c5692e9c83c78b055c57cb682df4ef2654b)

13. only put in the effort they put in . every great girl i met online put in an effort in our conversations while those who are not dont . if they dont move on or play it for sex otherwise you found a good one
   (ID: 803d3eb0d3664275a2ad6840048dba9d4d991cf7)

14. there will always be people who disapprove . they however do not matter . if it works for you that ' s all that matters . it ' s worked for many . it wor in s for me though in opposite . i ' m digit years up on my wife .
   (ID: 570664fde0bec86b7f35fdcea9073ef88e78798d)

15. its more the " it ' s ok for me to have slept with a lot of people  have sex on the first date because i ' m a guy . but if a girl does it , she ' s a slut . " that ' s a problem imo . if you ' re not being hypocritical than i don ' t think it ' s an issue . i think there is some on the reverse too  " it ' s ok for me to have slept with someone of the same gender , i ' m a woman . but if a guy does it , he ' s gay . " basically  don ' t shame someone you wouldn ' t have them shame you for .
   (ID: 0dd32da9f7e822909c258818ed313736b958a15a)

16. i think that cheating should be some sort of crime . if you make a commitment , you stay true to it . if you don  t want to honor the commitment don  t have a relationship with someone who does want a commitment
   (ID: 8f17a8aa41d6f9ae6bf4690376763808f9363f80)

17. if you throw away your friends for not sharing the same political views as you , then you were never friends to begin with
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

18. just so i understand  you  re gay but have a girlfriend and this isn  t enough to keep up your charade . you need to make the guys you hang out with jealous by making this girl dress to show off her body . then you  re going to introduce this girl to your family and want her to dress like this again for them . what  s the plan here ? you seem like you don  t know what you want . in another thread , you say you  re coming out to your mother because you don  t have any money . you  re all over the place . any way you could just be your authentic self ? or if you  re going to remain closeted to some in your family , why march this girl around having her partake in your lie ? you could just be single .
   (ID: 5d0b750bf77c2c6e8b41ebf03caf4038a907b876)

19. what do you want ? answer that first even just to yourself and then it will be clearer what you should do . i want hugh jackman to come over to my house and rub me with oil and roger me senseless . i can want all i want  nothing wrong with wanting . it is just that what we want is not always going to happen .
   (ID: 787b93a7786c68b0f31fb63e18ccf3551bafae1b)

20. well , you don ' t bring it up on a first date . just show her during foreplay .
   (ID: 6227692d2c261d0ca079ff0b4b03c8c2a6933b88)
