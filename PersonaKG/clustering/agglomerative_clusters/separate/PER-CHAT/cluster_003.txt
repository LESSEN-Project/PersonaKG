6. i didn ' t know that about the flowers at the zoo . that is really sweet . i know i keep asking questions , so if you don ' t want to respond you don ' t have to , but why are his kids not considered authentic ? is it like they are just using his name to cash in or do they just not have the same amount of passion as their dad ?

9. naw , it ' s doubtful . his wife also works there , and she is both gorgeous , and keeps a close eye on those he hires as his secretaries . in fact i am pretty sure it did the hiring . besides , if he was going to cheat on her , why would he pick someone who looks so similar ? i just wonder how a guy who has digit kids doesn ' t know what it sounds like for the woman to give birth . like during the call for example , towards the end , he was amazed that she knew what she was doing , and she laughed and told him it wasn ' t her first time  he knows full well we have digit children at home . he ' s here for supper at least every few weeks so they can go over work while i take them out for some quality time .
