1. nta your cousin fails to realize you will be changing lives . yours . your life matters and you have to do what you have to do . and just because you use it now doesn ' t mean you can ' t donate some later .
   (ID: de9f62a8114c08877e3a53460027d9810f5f3912)

   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

4. i strongly disagree . mace is awesome . here is why  digit it ' s non  lethal  digit it ' s cheap  digit it ' s very good at blinding and disorienting an opponent  digit it can be carried almost anywhere . ccw is better than mace . however , if for some reason you cannot concealed carry , mace is a thing to use . not a knife lethal , bad stopping power , requires a lot of skill to use effectively , not a taser too easy to miss , dense clothing can defeat  mace . because mace is non  lethal and cheap , it can be used in a situation where deadly force is excessive . when in doubt , spray opponent with mace and run away . also , you really should be aware how mace works before using mace . if you decide to carry it , watch some tests on youtube . read advice . buy two cans of mace , spend one on target practice to get a hang of it and carry second one . or , better , carry more than one can . tl  dr mace is better than knife , baseball bat or other improvised weapons . edit  i just remembered one very important thing . mace is not scary . do not threaten people with mace . do not even hint you have mace . when in doubt , spray and run immediately . threatening people with mace does not work .

   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

7. proposals in front of a whole crowd would be terrible . i have always thought a nice one would be very intimate and just in a really nice location at a nice time of our lives . i think if a genuine man puts in effort and real thought that ' s what matters . my sister still lives at home underneath my mother ' s house . she got proposed to by him getting on one knee under the house . worked for her but i would be underwhelmed lol . nothing hard about going somewhere beautiful and secluded . but hey , marriage isn ' t about much of this anyway . it ' s a promise to someone to love them entirely as a human for as long as that person is alive . to be the other half of that human through all of life ' s journeys . choose wisely .
   (ID: 7a3a98777bf2cebb6bd14409075a19b82035e535)

   (ID: 8797828a745ecd521e3b219ff004d26777b4f4f7)

11. i ' m not doing one for the same reasons . i ' ve had to go to wedding showers and always thought what ' s the point ? besides just showering the bride with more attention , which is something i never wanted . if you do end up having one , keep in mind that couples showers are becoming a big thing , so it doesn ' t have to be gender specific .
   (ID: 169c51cc138a4161080068ded4dcf87863ffee36)

12. you said it . elimination . doing dmg that btw can be healed dsnt mean you wouldnt get rekt by your 10hp foe . get the kill or not , its perfect like this
   (ID: ea4bfffa24eb7289b7b7bdfe0eded204916c7fd9)

   (ID: 30572ac5982532854b2ead41285ed9bbaba6d654)

14. maybe i am just bad at using them but my experience has been they don ' t help a lot with deer while bow hunting . if you can ' t get close with out one they are not a silver bullet for fixing bad sneaking , add to that they get caught on everything until you get used to moving in them and they get warm . that being said they are uncomfortably good for hiding from people . we had a rather large fellow bring his double xl curvy lady out to the woods for some public private time . they started getting undressed about digit feet from where my buddy and i where sitting in on a hill . they freaked out when we got up to walk away because , neither of us wanted to watch what was about to go down .

   (ID: c7e5f1c7a94109955f94d7acd2417ffad0ba60db)

16. no , you simply develop a never satiable hunger for more . it  s human greed . the root of everything wrong .
   (ID: 9414b9913220ebe2601862e3001aac74ebcffe33)

17. if you do what ? let the sewer system back up ? i doubt anyone could intentionally cause this to happen .
   (ID: b7bafa43c2042c67f5b5788063ae6a819ce4bb29)

18. think about all the ways this plane could go down . fires , structural problems . you know how cheap airlines are these days , what if they ignored some maintenance or ' forgot ' to fix something ? maybe you ' ll hit a flock of birds and disable the engines . is that turbulence or is something wrong ? you ' re just sitting here , helpless .
   (ID: b863480affffa35b0ead5c7bc5daa4c4099c0cee)

19. i ' m using a phone without a number right now , i ' m not sure if it would work . i hate to ask , but would you mind doing it ? sorry , i ' m probably just really scared right now .
   (ID: 9f31985e70e208f2dc692e2c378f1707cedd3bc9)
