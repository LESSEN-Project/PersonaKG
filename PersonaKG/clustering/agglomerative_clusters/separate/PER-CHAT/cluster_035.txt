2. some guy shot up digit mosques and killed digit people . he live  streamed the whole thing . literally a few days ago . it  s just a bad time to post a meme like this . normally i  d be fine but there are certain circumstances that are bad at the moment . he said during his digit min stream stuff like ,  fortnite taught me how to floss .  and  sub to peddiepie  kinda surprised you haven  t heard about it yet but the reddit community has stayed out of it so far .

7. i was nearly going to leave my comment as " other than that " but i added " one event " to try and stop this sort of response coming . in no way am i saying that winning a major isn ' t much to do in a year all i ' m saying is to say he didn ' t have the best digit isn ' t wrong just because he got that event win .

8. i had digit work husbands before i had a real husband . i felt like it was my duty to remind them of their wives ' birthdays , their anniversairies and the coolest dolls for their daughters . sometimes i ' d shop for gifts for their wives . other than that i did not but into their marriages at all . the third dude got flirty so i totally backed off from him . basically no contact unless it was strictly for work . we no longer work together so we don ' t speak . i no longer work with the other guys either but we ' re still pals and visit each other even though i ' m digit miles away .

16. might be why . that was always a big flaw in hoenn but i never noticed it when i originally played sapphire and emeraldi was like digit or digit . now when i play as or replay emerald , it really annoys me . fighting on water always annoys me though , so even in diamond where it wasn ' t that prevalent it still annoyed me . my grass starter just obliterated all the water types anyways but it felt like a chore .

20. i played from digit  digit . i recently came back a a joke but one of my friend decided to join me . we made a world and it is actually fun for me . we ended up getting digit other friends on the world and now we have a survival world that i  m proud of and i actually enjoy this game , especially the aquatic update and all the new stuff . i hope the developers continue making this great and don  t become over  confident and ruin it like bo4 . i love this game again and i hope that never changes .
