3. don ' t say that . the fact that you are afraid to lose your creativity is well enough a reason to continue this fight . you have to keep at it because you deserve to be happy and have every right to enjoy life . waking up every day is you winning this fight . seeking help is winning this fight . dont be afraid to quit something or start something , be it medication or not . if something doesn ' t suit you or brings you to a negative state of mind , change it , talk to someone about it , or eliminate it completely . keep up the fight .

   (ID: 08da4119a215672a002df8147181afbb771a75f9)

6. i ' m not gonna say that you ' re ok , so many people have made the mistakes you have and to get out of it you have to work hard . then you will be happy about your life and not need anyone else to tell you your doing ok , because you ' ll know you are .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

7. masturbate as much as you want , but only tell the people you trust the most . also use headphones while watching porn , i think thats obvious but hey . dont be afraid of watching hentai either , you might like it more . dont get a girlfriend yet , stick to your friends and if you find a girl you like make absolute sure she isnt just asking you out or pretending to like you to leave you alone for the next digit months . if she does that she dont need you . if youre gonna have sex young , use condoms . no way do you want to get a girl pregnant when youre both underage . dont play fortnite . the cancer will affect you . i would recommend apex legends . i went to a party the other night and i saw a kid who very obviously plays fortnite do the orange justice . you do not want to be that kid . also dont buy fortnite merch , it just shows you like cancer being on your clothes . if you dont have many friends , thats good . being in a group of digit or more is too much . stick to a small group who will be loyal and honest with you when you do something wrong .

8. i ' m not sure that i ' ll ever figure it all out . i do have to say that waiting so long to change from male mode to female mode was a good thing and a bad thing all in one . good because i knew that what i definitely wanted out of life and bad because i waited so long to start . but , everything happens for a reason . i wish you the best hun ! you got this !

9. shunning women  relationships , the amount of stress it has taken off my shoulders is indescribable . we live in a day  age where people are expected to look amazing , have great jobs etc . mostly for the benefit of others , especially the opposite sex . getting rid of my social media etc , and realising i don ' t want a relationship was a good decision in my case , i can now focus on me , and what i actually want to do with my life on a personal level without worrying about getting a girlfriend , if i ' m good looking  cool enough etc .

10. so did i , actually ! one day it just all fit into place and so i started devouring everything i could find about trans lives and the science behind it . you can never know too much exactly and to be honest , you don ' t really need to relate to or understand someone ' s struggles to be able to support them through it . it ' s called being a decent human being . thank you , friend  digit

11. all depends on your background and motives . empathy of someone is a must . for me , as a nice guy trust me please . you need this one thing , secret tip . you need to process that every person , even at worse has had a different situation to you in the past and you do not know where , or how they became who they are . you look at yourself , and your traits and be thankful , postives overcome negatives if you think that .

12. i really want to just say thank you , i was nervous opening up about my fear on such a large platform . i wake up knowing i have so much potential with how i ' m able to handle myself in different situations . i often ask and find myself noticing how much lack of common sense their is in the world and i ' m quick to pick things up and feel like i have great communication skills . i feel torn inside my heart and mind at times but i need to get my shit together one step at a time and just focusing on my future . it ' s just i still find myself not knowing how with what field i can excel in . so i will need to work on the basics .

13. i ' m not sure how you don ' t have a slew of comments here , but i ' d say that you ' re better built that digit   of the overweight us here i ' m sure someone will object with that . i ' d say that you ' re a catch for most anyone and if you had some desire to get more defined , you are at a perfect starting point . from what you ' re posting here , i ' d think that your body isn ' t what ' s kept you single . get on out there and have confidence .

14. one might wonder if it was your experience , and not your age that had to do with that though . i can certainly see the draw of stability , but im sure your kids love you regardless .
   (ID: 4972a31c1a3df007d761e27a613a3b6a99c3a0ca)

15. does anyone else try to tell themselves if they get alzheimer ' s or dementia , they will be able to handle it ? i think about that all the time . edit  punctuation .
   (ID: 7c7d6a809e77ab08fc65ee63a1ab44c11bd6ab7f)

16. my past self is an asshole , so i want to continually upstage and do everything better than that guy
   (ID: 6212c082850f067a67618ad2a3b9f8ed336590f4)

17. to not be a shitty person
   (ID: 62dd5d4401c12ad4672526fa5c980c544020cf98)

18. orthotics i personally don ' t do a lot of running . but when i go on the occasional hike , my foot will hurt slightly , but never anything serious . the doctor actually recommended me orthotics , but the softer kind .
   (ID: 3cc393500aaac3a2ee1cd96955cee486bb062a46)

19. yes , this piece of you missing sounds like the social part you reserved for people who do not accept you . i am sorry to hear that but no you can seek out new social ties from people who accept you for who you are . i can  t promise it will be easy and you may always miss what you have lost but it will get better if you remain open to new relationships .
   (ID: ead4924f7abc0f9258d2b484a3f379aedee2cc5c)

20. it wasn  t any changes that i made . but changes others made . from small things like talking to me , or coming over . it  s still not something i  d do on my own even when im feeling at my worst . but my close friends and my so being there just often enough really helps . so the advice id give for anyone in need of help is just talking . you don  t need to do it often and talks never need to be serious , but simply having company can help more than you know .
