1. not that i ' ve ever heard , this is just bizarre . it could just be an excuse to leave faster , if they don ' t get along  he doesn ' t get along with your brother . sounds super weird .
   (ID: e74c4268e9e1c5f9cadf933981b55c5a5aa0d1f2)

2. like at times he ' s unnecessarily judgemental about people . about views he doesn ' t agree with and i call him out for that saying that he should be more inclusive and less judgemental . then he ' ll get all defensive about how i ' m disrespectful without even registering my views and what i actually meant to say . he just wants me to agree with everything he says and not have any views that oppose his .

3. hey it  s good you  ve acknowledged you have a problem ! i don  t think disliking your boyfriends watching porn is inherently a crazy thing but the depths to which it  s making you suffer isn  t normal . do you have any trauma or mental illness history ? things of that nature can influence feelings like this . i know you said you  ve tried therapy but i would give it another go , and or make it a requirement that your bf  s don  t watch porn . some men don  t watch it in the first place

4. feels like a one side of the story . i could see how you weren ' t one that missed an opportunity to point out in the last digit . digit years to tell john he ' s a loser as often as he said you ' re a drone . i can ' t imagine someone would constantly harass you like that without anything coming back . but if he ' s truly the only " bad guy " in your stories , which i kinda doubt , then your reaction would be more justifiable . however , it was still incredibly childish and a dick move . just talk about the issue you have with him like an adult ffs . you guys are 27yo  is it so hard to talk about how you don ' t think it ' s productive to constantly harass each other ? what ' s the point ? and if he continues to be a child about then talk to your friends about it in a way  " look , i respect and want to support john in what he ' s doing and wish him all the success in the world  however he can ' t stop harassing me for what i am doing and is very insultive about my way of life  i don ' t see any other option than not interact with him anymore because he can ' t be an adult about the situation  then see what they have to say  might suggest . do that than rather making a fool out of yourself and completely escalate the situation in a childish way in front of your whole social circle .

5. side note  we ' ve only been married one year . i ' m pretty sure he ' s not gay . but i guess i really can ' t be sure . he takes a mild antidepressant , but that ' s all . i took pictures of his computer history to see what exactly it is if i could do anything but a lot of it is granny , family , and other incest .

6. a good way to help is to you is to talk about your own insecurities . my wife is great at doing this , and it ' s one of the reasons i fell in love with her . first off , even if his insecurities are silly in your opinion , don ' t tell him that . he has to come to that conclusion on his own . don ' t say , " oh , nobody cares about that . " since he ' s insecure about it , it ' s obviously a big deal to him right now . once my wife started talking about some of the things she ' s insecure about , i realized they are things other people myself included thought very little about . not only did it make me trust  love her more , it made me understand that my insecurities might not be such a big deal after all .

7. i  m guessing you  re a women . if you were a man , you would not have this opinion . does your husband know you are on the internet ? p . s . i didn  t bother reading the content past the heading . as a woman , your opinion is only half that of a mans anyway .

8. that just sounds like he ' s having a tough time as an adult or starting out as one . i have a feeling i ' m going to end mine sort bois
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

9. this sounds exactly the same for me . it only seems to be other males that have problems with my dog . should i consider neutering him now even though he ' s digit months old ? we have no intention of breeding him , but i always thought that if there were no problems with him being boisterous or aggressive then there was no need to remove them .
   (ID: 03e00c6684f9fe5cb2996bc794372ee9a7a2aea8)

10. i ' d probably ask him if he wants to get lunch with me or something nice
   (ID: 009af0be6850d8d1ff9d388a3c7f39f0f7727594)

11. what the actual fuck ? i just don ' t understand those people at all . your stepfather should go get two full time jobs if that ' s such a good idea
   (ID: 752bae2818e8a99ea6b8b00277a3811570a73708)

12. judging by your replies to other comments it doesn  t seem like you are very interested in hearing any opinion that isn  t   your husband should totally cave and you guys need another baby  . one comment you talk about how it  s not fair for you to not get another human child because your husband wants a . boat . in another comment someone tells you that their ex  husband tried to force another child onto them and it  s what caused their divorce . and your biggest concern is if he had gotten the children he finally wanted afterwards ? in reality , if this were posted but in reverse . if a gentleman was on here talking about how it  s just not fair that his wife won  t have another baby and he was pissy and angry about it . not listening to anyone  s advice and wanting to argue why he should get his way . reddit would tear him the fuck up and you know it .

13. hon , you need to think about yourself here . i know that can be hard , especially if you ' re a giver by nature , but it ' s true . if you don ' t feel safe , comfortable , and respected in your relationship , you won ' t be truly happy . and that may not seem like the end of the world now , but it will in time . eventually , bitterness and resentment can start to grow and you ' ll find yourself hating the person you once loved . if you don ' t think you can be happy dealing with his bipolar disorder , it ' s ok to move on . it ' s better that both of you find partners you can truly be fulfilled and happy with , even if it means going through some pain first .

14. they do this . honestly , nothing may be wrong at all . he may not need as much communication and affection as you do . my husband does a few of these things as well . however , he is on the spectrum , and i just know it is how he is comfortable . and i ' m ok with that . that being said , if it makes you uncomfortable or unhappy , you need to come to terms with that truth and decide what you need to do to make you happy .
   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)

15. sounds like he has that " talking constantly " disorder . these people are insufferable but i dont think they can help themselves . their families put up w the constant talk but these people usually grate on their friends who almost always distance themselves . or ue could just be extremely selfish  wad probably catered to as a child .
   (ID: e3a7bbfa5fde0a706f721c3dc5055b3a8963f79f)

16. honestly i suffered from retroactive jealousy for a while myself , there ' s not much you can do except hope he comes to terms with his issues , try to do some research on how you can help him .

17. few men can resist swatting a woman ' s ass when presented in that manner ! lol . i see what you mean about the difference between wanting and needing submission . i hadn ' t thought about it in those terms . i think you ' re in a much better place than you realize , though  you ' ve grown confidence and you ' ve clearly thought through your emotions and understand yourself pretty well . you know you have a weakness , and you know you want to overcome it . your miles ahead of most people , and you have what hopefully is a promising relationship with a guy who won ' t push you back toward your old behavior because your relationship isn ' t based on a bdsm dynamic or even a common interest . and if he agrees to give you a light spanking now and then , so much the better !

18. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .
   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

19. woah this hit home . i was in a very similar situation for digit  digit years with two friends who put me through the same shit you were put through . and i understand why you are scared because so am i . the thought of them makes my blood boil . do you live in another city to him or ?
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

20. calmly ask him why he impulsively reacts the way he does . calmly explain how that in turn makes you react . then say wouldn  t it be better if we could have a relationship where i wasn  t afraid of you ? one where i could come to you for anything ? if that doesn  t get to him nothing will .
