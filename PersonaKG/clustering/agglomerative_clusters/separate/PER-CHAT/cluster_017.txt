1. given that there are over digit english variations of the protestant bible alone , it ' s hardly surprising .
   (ID: 6aca29520994a85891e32b7ad6030791dfa1cbe2)

2. lower than all of the above
   (ID: dc0783c6951122c6edfc85430901cf133c146b32)

3. if you hold people to impossible standards , you ' re going to be disappointed . what if the perfect man for you isn ' t exactly " hollywood handsome ? " you ' re excluding a lot of people because you ' re too picky . also , you might not be as great as you think . if you ' re so great and you ' re still single , there might be a reason . maybe your personality .

4. not really . i always assume everything is fake until proven otherwise  in this case , on a personal level , it doesn ' t effect the sadness of it .

5. nh is " live free or die " and surrounded by states that have legalized weed and yet .
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

6. you ' re an idiot who clearly hasn ' t lived in very many countries . welfare is not what builds the nice parts of town or the transport channels to get a coke into the hand of any person in earth . rich people do , for their own benefit and the benefit of those who work for them . just because a few assholes kill the farm and pocket a tax break instead of giving you personally a job on a micro level doesn ' t mean trickle down economics doesn ' t elevate everyone on a macro level . i repeat , go live somewhere not built by the rich if you disagree .

7. saw dogs getting killed for food . it wasn ' t even an ethical kind of kill , they just beat the dogs until they stopped whining . the dogs did even fight back btw , it ' s also on youtube

   (ID: 89c3606d2dfc5d2a2da97fb49ddc1894f8bf330f)

9. once transhumanism and robotics happen it will get better . human with the internet still might fart and stink , but you can find out when the gran chaco war took place . technology provides opportunities if used wisely
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

10. spouting hate in this thread too ? of course you are . and it  s because you know when your pitiful life eventually ends you won  t have a tenth of the people at your funeral as this young lady did . she  s honored and respected by her community . you on the other hand are an insignificant shit stain .
   (ID: faebbe18abd4d1c69e3bb9106178f797255444c5)

11. was in er while i was waiting for my brother he had appendicitis and someone came in with an axe in his fucking head . he ' s definitely dead .

12. i mean , we threaten drifter too .  my guardian just went through an army to get to one servitor , you have an army ?  i think we  re one of the strongest , and reading the books of sorrow really enforce that , but drifter and anor won  t be going up against us 1v1 so they are definitely a threat . also , by video game law , we can kill anyone we want . i think we have the potential to be the most powerful guardian ever , but right now there people who experience makes them stronger than us .

16. you are the one talking about people in the west using " freedom for profit . do not pass the ball to me . minority groups in china getting locked up for " re  education " purposes is a fact whether you want to believe it or not . if the chinese communist government is so great then why are people from shanghai demanding independence ? not sure what the rest of your fluff is about . i guess you had to hit that word count .
