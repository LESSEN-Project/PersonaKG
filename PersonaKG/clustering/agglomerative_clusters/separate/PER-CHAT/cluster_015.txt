3. portkeys are a fairly common spawn if you have inventory space , just walk around a bit and they will come . as for the map , what you see is what you get . depending on how active local players are , there may be a discord group where you guys can get organized and share nest locations , ideal grinding spots , etc .

4. producing an average digit episode anime costs around  digit million , and if you want to provide animators with a liveable wage , especially in america , that ' s going to increase quite significantly . and that ' s when the studios are already established . so i ' d say start by building up some capital .

5. don ' t see it .

6. the problem with jtr is that it takes over digit months to farm the vets , so if you delay a bit you might lose her the next time she comes around . to answer the question we have to know where you are at in the game . is your guild close to hsr ? does your guild complete haat ? would you like to try and catch the next meta if the kotor character breaks the meta ? one thing you have to have in mind is how long are you going to take to farm jolee and zaalbar . for instance , ill be refreshing bastila , jolee and zaalbar nodes once a day , so it will take about digit months to digit  them , with 3x cantina refresh a day ill farm the other two in time . are you going to refresh the hard nodes ? if you are not , then these guys are the bottleneck .

9. nothing changed ? what are you talking about ? the defensive meta is gone after all the changes . it ' s not as reliable as before to stay on defense . for honor is in a digit times better place than it was when this year began and there was no way to do damage unless you picked a dlc character and everything was shadowed by timesnap and it felt clunky . sure , they need to optimize conq ' s bashes and some more character , but even if they leave it where it is , it ' s still a fuck ton better than year digit and a little bit into year digit .

10. happy birthday ! i ' m not a big fan of birthdays either , i ' ve had too many of them .

12. brecci was good though , this isn ' t . i wasn ' t saying it was the remington , it ' s the only comparable in one shot kill type of way . it ' s bad when i ' d rather use fists in half the gun fights tbh . and the sg12 isn ' t garbage unless you can ' t click the trigger more than two times . any average player can use the gun like any other , sure it ' s no saug , but it ' s still way better than the mog12 . it ' s just depressing .

20. yes its an fsa gossamer . do i have to find like for like or will another brand do ? only the ones i ' ve found online are a little out of my price range . i bought the bike on the ' cycle to work scheme ' and it didn ' t even occur to me to check the cost of replacement parts
