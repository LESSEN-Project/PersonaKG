1. some random garden type thing that my mom brought me to when i was like digit . it was a wip then . i  ve brought it up multiple times , saying that we should go check it out , and she doesn  t remember . it  s too vivid to have not existed .

2. a lot of disney movies or maybe even things like spongebob squarepants because there are so many hidden references that you only get after you ' ve grown up .

3. i can only speak from a mother  s perspective . i have a daughter who is digit and went from private to public school this year . i watch my children all the time for any changes in behaviors and actions . everyday i ask how school was and ask what they learned , what they ate for lunch , etc . because it is their first year in public school i test the waters and ask ,  do you still like your school ?  they answer yes but if they were to answer no then it could open a conversation as to why . to press it , i would probably agree to find another school if they can give me good reason why to try to open them up to discuss the problems they have . i know parental relationships are different but maybe there is a different way to get the information out of her . asking a different set of questions . if not your parents then maybe you can come to her as a sibling . share something relatable . i just wish the best for her . as a parent , this post pulled on my heart strings .
