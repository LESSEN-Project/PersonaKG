   (ID: 85bffe0bb9cbc6b9878fa42cd379cd2d4c7a27e1)

8. i will admit i worried about that a bit when we went to new zealand for our honeymoon . saw a lot on the internet about rampant tourism being out of control , etc . it turned out to be fine . we went in the end of a shoulder season us thanksgiving and built an itinerary of all the " second best " or " less popular but great " things  for example , hiking isthmus peak instead of roy ' s peak near wanaka  spending time in wanaka instead of queenstown . never underestimate the ability of crowds to all take the same photo and go to the exact same digit places .

9. it  s sort of a human pheromone . certain smells attract us like how we know something tastes good before we eat it based on how it smells .
   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

10. tradition , and the fact using it doesn ' t mean it ' s an endorsement of religion , or way to force people to participate in it . it ' s a reference point . if it helps , we ' re actually about digit years off , so you can know " we got it wrong " , and take solace in that .

   (ID: b85d09c5bfb3611a720f11287b9483cc0802908d)

13. then tell your glorious leaders that . that said , hamas gets equipment from somewhere , so they ' re getting support from someone . i don ' t really care enough to find out who or how , i ' m sure the fine people of reddit will argue that point to death , so there ' s that .

14. why is it different ?
   (ID: 3cd6cbd0ced9eeece859e4e31c6ae046d9711c59)

15. i don ' t even know what to say , like do you drink wine and read books all day explain please cause being in france on holiday and try to get someone to speak english is impossible just because they refuse it ? i myself prefer the very down to earth , high all day on herbs  tea mess around with chemicals dutch lifestyle .

17. do you know what kind of people who believe that all the media are lying except for their leader ? crazy people , fanatics , and cultists
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

18. when i play video games and someone ' s name supports a politician or political system they ' re always garbage . when someone supporting communism goes digit and digit i can understand why they support communism and it makes me not want communism even more than i already do . so when i see a literal retard say fuck donald trump i wonder where the downs syndrome obama haters are . and you would think there would be more of them since liberals abort their retards while conservatives can ' t get enough of them . this is why you have to bag your own groceries in blue states while in red states it ' s done for you .
