2. that should have been on my pro list too , but it was horrible losing my mom and other loved ones the first time around , especially those that i knew the end was coming for a while . but to have to do it again knowing exactly when they would die . i don ' t know if i could do it .

   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

12. as a kid , hell . i was the youngest , so i was constantly picked on , and my parents would tell me " don ' t provoke them " even when i hadn ' t done anything . they also acted like if one of us knew something , we should all know it , even though some of us had way less experience  education than the others . and yes , parents have favorites , and it makes the others feel inferior as shit . as an adult , we stopped fighting and now it ' s like we ' re friends that will never grow distant , even if we don ' t see each other for ages .

13. they certainly do . i ' m sure there are thousands of people in this world just like my sister and me . we went through the most horrendous and abusive childhood and it probably wasn ' t as bad as some . i ' m sure there are worse . it ' s sad really because it ' s people like you that perpetuate these situations by calling the victims liars . you only believe that a few high profile individuals like hitler or mao can commit this type of torture . unfortunately they live right in your neighborhood . you go right ahead and live with your rose colored glasses and disregard the cruelties going on right under your nose . in your world it ' s the kid ' s fault , isn ' t it ?

15. syphilis my bother to the best of my knowledge does not have syphilis but it would be entertaining to have them think he does
   (ID: 87564c50904c4e4801d5e96e4913f38c10582ea1)

16. you took care of someone else ' s kid . that ' s nothing like actually having a kid of your own , so of course it seemed easier lol .
   (ID: ecc98de1e575d7e863a2124b364b8ed586778ba5)

17. neither of the cheaters are my family , but some of my family members are friends with them . you ' re right , though , it is gross and before this we were all like family .
   (ID: 699bf0afe2f1405d2208320e80156a99e90d356e)

18. and what if those kids families were killed in the wars they now serve and the only thing they can do to survive is to take up arms . not justifying just saying

19. i think i once saw something that said that because you spend a lot of time together you end up looking similar , mostly tan .
   (ID: 01ce69fc209a030b404f270c5d5a650bbb706d87)

20. regardless of the selfishness in your ideas , which caused the existance of the kids in the first place , in going to say that my point is , that you cant expect kids to be slaves because you provide them food and shelter . " i give you shit , so you should do exacly as i say " that sounds like a regular employment , except the kids can ' t quit . they have to put up with you . and they dont even realise that because you have fashioned their brains the way you want . im digit and took me digit years and living away from home to realise that parents are the entitled ones . i hope for the sake of kids , fair doesn ' t only come in octomber to your house too .
