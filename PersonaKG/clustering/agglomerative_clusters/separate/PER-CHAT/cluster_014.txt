3. honestly , i ' ve thought about this too much , i would start work at the food  dessert place as a waitress they frequently visit and get to know all the familiar customers and if i hear a comment about someone doing something disastrous . i ' ll get the said person to refer them to the said shop and i ' ll poison them . it ' s doesn ' t ever link back to knowing the person personally or anything either .
