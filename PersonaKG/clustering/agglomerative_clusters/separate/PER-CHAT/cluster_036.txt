1. nta judging by the fact you could pay off all her debt , plus buy her a new car it was obviously a decently large sum , that i agree with you i would not just randomly hand out to a girlfriend of digit months that you do not live with or are engaged to . maybe you could of helped her a little if you really wanted to , but you have no obligation to give her that money , or justify how you spend your hard earned money .

2. it was fun for the first few months i had it . which is an unpopular opinion , but i was in the part of my life where it would be fun most of the time to always be tripping . now it ' s been three years and i ' m married and expecting my first kid and it ' s not so fun anymore . and i ' m sure it won ' t be fun when i look at my kids face the wrong way and see some sort of demon thing . i haven ' t seen the color white without geometrical shapes and rainbow lights for digit years . i miss it . it ' s become the norm now , and it makes a lot of people tell me that i can ' t do my job as a caretaker and that i ' m not going to be a responsible parent because i have this . it ' s not all fun and games it seriously affects people ' s lives . if it ' s not so bad for you then great , i ' m happy for you , but that doesn ' t mean other people aren ' t suffering .

3. i don ' t know how i could give it to her , though . my room is the only place where the dogs can be separated from which sucks

4. no , it ' s quite normal to be sedated for it . you generally have to ask for them to keep you awake . it sounds like a failure of the anesthesiologist if they were unable to keep you sedated , and it ' s battery unless you told them you want to be awake plus you described it as what sounds like battery to me .

5. i would stuff someone in there with you . no one should be alone on valentine ' s day .
   (ID: d6e89a045ccd97a556ff87527d8a08a8e3c89fc1)

6. like i said i never went on vacation by myself , so i dont know if x country is cheaper than y . so if the kind people of reddit can point me in right direction , that would be great

7. why , did you loose one ?
   (ID: a6171234e1a4ec65a39ad55aa0aa058eb98dff83)

8. never done weed but i  m gonna say not too similar at all . anesthesia has you in your right mind but you randomly do things and say things that you were even screaming at yourself not to do . and the action doesn  t even register in your mind . it  s like it never happened . plus you don  t remember much either .
   (ID: 903829fb4aefc18f9ba3e0dc7d2f3267adf2bcc8)

9. beyond how much money you need , there are some other things to think about . furniture  don  t try to move furniture across the country . look for a furnished place to rent  first , or better yet , stay with family at 1st . you  re barely going to be there anyways . clothes  take your favorite outfits , and enough to get through about a month without washing clothes . you aren  t going to have time . your favorites just because i already know that while you won  t wear them again , you aren  t ready to get rid of them just yet . stuff  ditch it , unless it  s something you want to save forever . money  not enough information in your post . are you looking to get your own place when you get there , or can you crash at family  friends house for a few months ? you  re going to make more money than you have time to spend once you get started . you  ll be able to get a really nice place in just a few months , but you won  t be there much .

10. do you have to buy her even if you have the season pass ?
   (ID: 3261c3c121a386d442cb607ca46561af4f956af5)

11. right , i can see why you would make that decision . i was thinking about the dark base too but i wasn ' t really sure about it . is it any good ? what can i expect from a case like that ?
   (ID: 2971f819c4d7400b9fa7806434e9037b6af4dfae)

13. it ' s the only assassin ' s creed i don ' t have ! which probably means someone else should get it . well damn
   (ID: 7a0302ed354e54bfa45e1de27055f29421f91f29)

14. not at all really , it ' s up to the op what they want to do with the post , not me .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

15. for you , it  s not . don  t bother . your mind is a stone .
   (ID: 0a256f5eb4d0481e09649002ce3285a96bf18329)

16. you have one now
   (ID: 8a0d7d262d95d9c10d914ff3b70f342e066aee23)

17. a stock market crash did happen , but he lost digit  of the money , and it should have regained it ' s value and a lot more in the previous digit years . what does she think your odds of winning are ? 10k sounds like a small risk if you have a good chance of winning hundreds of thousands .
   (ID: ff39f069f8b23a1fe1a55ce497714a8d205eb0fa)

18. remember this isn ' t the actual list . it sucks for now , but theres always hope that something gets hit which makes the price less ridiculous . maybe after shvi the deck goes the way of qlips and turns into dark planet turbo .

19. at first i thought i ' d pay for lawn mowing and gutter cleaning , but then i thought i ' d be liable and get sued if the teen got hurt doing either of those , so they ' re out . on the other hand , i ' d happily pay  digit to have someone install a turnkey linux setup on a refurbished windows pc that i ' d provide . i might pay more , but with less happiness , ha . tell them something like " i want linux with gimp , a photo managing  display program , something to edit  play videos with , something that will play mp3s , a word processor , and internet ready " and have it all set up for me .
   (ID: a31ab3f3ccb2d987e0948a7a8ed52f5d74b72960)

20. i also have bad asthma and would also want to know any ideas to help me sleep at night if this proceeds
