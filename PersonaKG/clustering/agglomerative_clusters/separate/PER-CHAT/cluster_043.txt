1. lol you are a joke .  she was the best i could looks  wise without paying for it , this is why my brain tricked me into thinking i loved the bitch . so you treat a woman like a commodity and are with her for her looks and then spew your bullshit hateful rhetoric when she does exactly what you did  or would do ? you  re telling me you wouldn  t have traded her up for a hotter piece of ass if you could ? the hypocrisy runs deep with you people . your though process is extremely flawed and pathetic but hey go your own way  women are so much better off without a little boy like you . you  re right life is unfair and unjust you  re just crying because you feel you aren  t good looking enough or rich enough to get what you feel entitled to . pathetic .

5. do you even process the way she responds to comments ?  oh some random person on the internet told me to cancel the ticket . so i cancel the ticket  she  he responds like a robot . and also look at the story lmao   he doesn  t work but not just that , he also doesn  t take care of our twin kids but not just that , he now wants to go on a trip to florida with his buddies but not just that , he also told me he wants to spend the money i earned to go to a strip club there . but . not . just . that . i also talked to him right after i wrote this post about it and apparently he also has a secret girlfriend that he leaves me for . welp sucks . who believes this bullcrap ? jesus . ppl like you need to be aware that a lot of posts on this subreddit are fictional , written by ppl that seek attention . too gullible , but hey , if it entertains you who am i to judge .

6. another okcupid story  awallpapergirl awallpapergirl i had been on the site for digit months and was getting plenty of dates . i had gone on digit   digit dates in that time . i was being really choosy about which women i would date a 2nd time . not many . i met a lot of different personalities , but a many of them were just different versions of my ex  wife . i got frustrated and decided to back off and be single for awhile . i went into my profile and removed all my pictures . i replaced my main photo with the standard car selfie that everyone takes while sitting in the driver ' s seat . i was making a few changes to the body of my profile and was ready to log off and not return for at least digit months . my finger was on the mouse and i was ready to log off , when a notification icon popped up . a profile view , and a new message all at once . both notifications were from the same woman . hmmmmm okay cupid , one more shot from your little bow . let ' s see what this gal has to say . i did not have high hopes . i opened the message and began reading . i was floored . in a good way . she was attractive , she was super smart sapiosexual here , she had a good job . a really good job , and she ' s a libra i ' m a scorpio . but she lived digit   digit miles away . she had spent over hour reading my profile . when i updated my photo , i popped up on the main home page . " look who just updated their profile ! " she saw the photo , thought i was attractive , and clicked on my profile . if i had not updated my profile at that time . and she had not been looking at the home page that very moment , we would never have connected . neither of us was searching for a date digit   digit miles away . i read her message and was immediately intrigued . i went to her profile page and began reading . like me , she had a very long and well written profile page . she had put time , thought and effort into writing a very honest page about what type of man she was looking for , what type of man she didn ' t want , and a bit about her lifestyle and daily habits . i was well past intrigued at this point . hope was not lost ! this gal might be worth the long drive . we met for lunch that friday . we both worked a digit  digit shift , so we each had every other friday off . i made the drive , and had set aside digit   digit . digit hours for a lunch date . i was traveling beyond her city to my father ' s house and was planning to spend the weekend working on his classic hot rod . it wasn ' t really out of my way to drive to her city , as my father ' s house was even future down that same highway . lunch took digit hours . we discussed the distance . i was already driving down to my father ' s house every weekend to work on restoring his hot rod . so i would stop by her place on friday for a date . then leave early saturday and head to dads . we worked on the car saturday and sunday and i would stop at her house on sunday evening . we ' d make dinner together and i ' d spend the night . then i would get up really early on monday and make the digit mile commute back to work . we ' ve been mostly inseparable since the day we met . there was an almost instant love between us . we respected each other , admired the other , and wanted to make it work despite the distance . i found a job in her city and moved in with her after digit . digit years dating . she asked me to marry her 2yrs and digit months after we met . of course i said yes . yes , i ' m a guy and she asked me to marry her it ' s absolutely wonderful . she ' s my rock and my keel . she keeps me balanced . she loves me and treats me like she could lose me at any moment . we compliment each other and make a great couple . soulmates isn ' t just a silly romantic word .

7. it sounds like friend a has reason to feel that way . if the two of you have expressed attraction to one another and don ' t have the courtesy of open communication with friend a , that gives rise to some suspicion . why are you hanging out without inviting friend a ? why are you two seemingly ganging up on friend a when they share these feelings of discomfort ? i ' m not saying you ' re betraying them , but it doesn ' t sound like you ' re being kind either . if the friendship falls apart , it sounds like it ' s because everybody had a hand in it , not just friend a .

8. this girl straight up told me , " if i ever have the opportunity to rape you , i will " not to sound cocky , but girls have always been attracted to me and i thought she was just trying to stand out , in some weird kind of way . i like dark humor so i befriended her . eventually i found out she wasn ' t joking as she literally tried to make opportunities . like , asking me to come stay the night and drink and do drugs even though she doesn ' t do either . she was very touchy feely .

9. found out my girlfriend of digit months was in fact a lesbian and didn  t know how to break it to me

10. i read , " however , she does seem to assume i don  t know what i am doing at all "  if my daughter was digit with a baby i would assume the same . being a parent is a major responsibility , i currently have digit . i ' m in college as well , and i ' m almost twice your age . college is literally the only thing i have the energy for outside of motherhood , i can ' t imagine what you would want to go out and do that your mother is like , " no , no , no " to .   x200b  as far as getting your mom to give you more freedom , she ' s probably afraid you ' re going to go out and get pregnant again  it ' s a very valid fear . she questions your judgement , your ability to be responsible . what she has to go on is you getting pregnant at digit . your first decision as an adult was to become a parent , it sounds like she ' s afraid you will continue to make decisions that have her questioning whether or not you are capable to live an adult life where you can make rational decisions for yourself .

11. don ' t be too hard on yourself my friend . you are aware of the fact that she might be too young for you . i don ' t know what the age of consent or how the legislation is in your country but well . you don ' t have to feel disgusted man , things like that happen . it is up to you how you act on these feelings , i would understand that the gap between digit and digit is quite large though , so your feelings might be somewhat justified . don ' t reject yourself by saying you shouldn ' t be attracted to her , just accept that it happened and move on . you ' re not a pedophile or a pervert mate , from the reads of it you ' re a pretty consious person . just accept the feeling and let it go . if there is anything that i could help you with feel free to respond or dm . don ' t judge yourself too hard , shit happens .

12. relax and remember she is a little girl . you are supposed to love her , but not in that way . know that if you had tried anything , it could crush your family . relationships will break apart . your family will grow distant . your parents would be shattered . your sister would be scarred forever . as an older brother , please try to remember the role you are meant to play in her life and try to forget any thoughts you have about her .

13. you have to remember as a child those pets are one of the few friends they have at home . i  d try breaking the news as soon as you can so she can at least try to understand . just tell her your situation and what you had to do .

14. i know you guys are gonna tell not be with someone who i can ' t trust you ' re goddamn right .  but hear me out . maybe we ' re just doing something wrong ? mmmm nope . you shouldn ' t date someone you can ' t trust .  i just wanna fucking know who she ' s talking to lol . bit controlling but okay . ask her if its that big of a deal .

15. coming from a girl who everyone assumed my whole life as " rich " sometimes it ' s not actual individuals that hold money , it ' s the family . my family has money , but they don ' t pay my bills . the only expensive jewelry i ever have received family bought  gifts  which is just likes purses , scarfs , etc . so she may be struggling just as hard as you are , her struggle just may look a lot more stylish thanks to her family . just a thought ! btw  i dont date " rich guys " because digit  are jerks so she could also feel that way !

16. sounds a lot like my story , honestly . your best bet is to talk to her about it . don ' t do what i did and hide it , it ' ll probably come back . digit divorces , digit years old , a ton of self esteem issues later and i ' m just starting the transition process now .

17. i think we ' re in agreement ? or by ' yep ' did you mean you would stop loving your mother for money reasons ?

18. no matter how hard i try she is still pointing over my shoulder
   (ID: fd9de666ca1e952a2f9c7367d60476a6d4b8b996)

19. she ' s only snored while i was conscious at least every few months before , last few weeks have been rough . i just sleep on the couch if it becomes a big issue . that sounds rough i guess , but i actually sleep at least as well if not better on the couch than in bed . i made sure to talk to her about it and make sure she knew there were no hard feelings and it was just a practical matter . i never start out there , and make a point to spend time talking to her and the bump before she goes to sleep every night , we just agreed i can bail if i need to .

20. it doesn ' t matter if you said " yes " at the time . you were a child and children can say yes to a lot of bullshit bc they are little morons . doesn ' t make them right . society knows that nothing a child says can be valid and of any importance , hence they can ' t have jobs , buy houses , lease cars etc . she was exercising power over you and exploiting your vulnerability . that ' s statutory rape . you can get her arrested for it .
