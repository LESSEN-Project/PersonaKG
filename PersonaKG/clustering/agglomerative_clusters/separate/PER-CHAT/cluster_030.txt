Total from this dataset: 184

1. i see no use in unions . why should i be forced to give up part of my pay to be in an organization i have no interest in . they promote themselves kind of like politicians . i live in a right to work state also and have never had issues which i couldn ' t handle myself . if you are valuable to your employer then you will be taken care of , if you are lazy then i could see a union being of use to you .
   (ID: f24af2fec683eb8f7c778684c641d964456c0341)

2. yes this is the reason why i don ' t buy a nc . its almost as if they are trying to make it realistic in the way that illegal activities are better money than honest ones . i wouldn ' t mind paying to keep my popularity up so i could have fun in my nc when ever i wanted .

4. romney allowed some folks to take his money and turn it into more money for him , and that qualifies as work ? yes , as a matter of fact i think our country would be doing a lot better if we elected people with janitorial experience to national office .

5. digit years is a long time . probably while the cops are busy with all the dumbasses . i will just commit tax fraud and take out a loan . move to japan . never pay anything off .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

6. from my understanding the gov ' t isn ' t going to flip the bill for the drug tests . the people he is drug  testing , the people trying to feed their families with what little money they have , will be paying . i most certainly do not agree with this policy , granted , if you don ' t have money for many things you shouldn ' t be partaking in nefarious substances , but that is irrelevant . a prerequisite of welfare shouldn ' t be a drug  test . have you had a job in the past digit years ? have you looked for a job in the last digit years . whats that ? yes ? ohh here you go . wait wait wait you ' ve smoked pot this month because life sucks ? sorry pal your kids will have to starve
   (ID: f4740ce860bfe6d6f36cf67cc925b9f182ade275)

7. i mean , how hard can it be ? same for homeless people . just buy a house
   (ID: 5a15ba0aaa5a6e6f9e3a2db25befda6ec40a9b88)

8. you keep telling everyone how lonley you are and how much you hate your dad just to get attention . everyone has fucked you , even the ugly ones . yet you still complain how poor you are .
   (ID: 9425493e0ea7469367495f8e5947330e536cafa9)

9. i think buying a large rv and just driving around the country would be cool . but not just going to tourist areas . i ' d want to see how different people live differently . that or work a bunch of different jobs to get an inside on how things work eg . be a care salesman for a month so learn how to buy a car better
   (ID: 9a6c8092baa903ed1df9f0bfae4b28070e199c8c)

10. i do it a lot . i give away about half of my art . still digit  positive feedback from my sales . if anyone feel like they didn ' t get what they paid for , they know they can come to me and we can work something out . i say there ' s no issue at all . when you pay , you get a whole different level of service and commitment to the art  as long as you treat your paying customers as paying customers , i doubt you ' ll get in trouble .
   (ID: bf371725cb05580378dda9b1fdb005417049b32b)

11. you just compare yourself to the people who are richer than you so you still don  t really feel rich or satisfied
   (ID: ad24fe51d61dbe3cddd863ba9cb6adae61265a06)

12. okay i found one extremely common problem for your car that seems to be correlated with an intermittent start and occasionally poor running conditions . on your distributor shaft underneath the distributor cap where all of the plug wires stem from there is a crankshaft position sensor . these apparently are notorious for going bad on jeeps from that era . they can be expensive . my shop manual says  digit so id have your mechanic friends test it for continuity before changing it . im pretty sure i just heard a gunshot ill finish this comment in a minute when i know im safe

13. i see , so when there are tons of coins , the inflation will be quite minimal , but unless the community grows quickly enough , the mining value could drop to the point where it ins ' t worth mining except for the charity aspect of it . bitcoin has struggled with this at times where the electricity cost of some computers that are less efficient is higher than the value they can earn by mining .
   (ID: b650c9c531ec58d468c7c1fc9b7083efc4cbca9c)

14. child support is generally automatically taken from paychecks . i ' ve always wondered how people refuse to pay child support if they have a job .
   (ID: 4d1c53b18fd4290c31e857fc9f9572542fef4fd5)

15. it depends on the evidence . if you  re a millionaire but they catch you in the act and on video with eye witnesses then a lawyer can  t do a miracle . but normally a case rests on less certain facts . the state will use their own experts to build a story of what went down . if you  re rich , you can afford your own experts to present an alternative story . the other aspect is how much time your lawyer has to devote to you . if you  re poor , your lawyer might get all of digit minutes to work on your case . if you  re rich , they can devote months to it and explore every little avenue available . if you  re really rich then you can make a donation to the political campaign of the da and get offered a lenient plea deal .
   (ID: d8e39e092041fc01f24bedce425d10f55bd2a764)

16. politicians are payed and must live on the average income level of where they represent so they can get their rich , priveleged heads out of their pampered assholes , see things from a regular person ' s pov , and want to make laws that actually benefit the majority of the people in their country . i can ' t believe there aren ' t more people that are talking about this . if we don ' t want politicians that only help the rich , why are most of our politicians rich ?
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

17. the best thing is not to " find a trick to fool yourself into not buying things " but to look how much money you earn in one month and don ' t spend more than that . it is irrelevant how much your credit card lets you spend . what matters is how much you earn .
   (ID: 417f107ec53971c82b0d9bb8ee79067ec512bdbb)

18. all my wealth is already someone else  s .
   (ID: f9e9b1e6c59393102159142841e750ea90023928)

19. kill nobody , rob the richest bank in nyc i already live in ny
   (ID: dd1a306ab5abb82ade20a2c7f74d928797a35a61)

20. it should be legal , and like every other business where people provide a service like hair dressers , nail techs , etc it should be regulated for health and job security . psych services should be provided as well .
