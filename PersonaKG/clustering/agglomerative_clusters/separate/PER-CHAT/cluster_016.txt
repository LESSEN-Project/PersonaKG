1. i totally agree , people should always keep it professional within the workplace . if you want to argue after , fine just don ' t let it effect your or somebody else ' s work .

2. my favorite part is where the programmers tell a joke and they think that robot doesn ' t understand because they screwed up the joke .

3. that ' s nice then , i can get behind the working with some buddies to complete the challenges and it makes it a lot easier for most people . i ' ve been waiting to get home to play , but i thought it was a constant thing , i hadn ' t seen that it had to be activated to use .

4. wonder woman has been kind of an oddity in the recent dc film universe . as good as it was it was still far from perfect . the third act is one of the worst in any superhero films . aquaman made a shit ton of money , you ' re right ! but as for quality of film ? it ' s still not as good as even the lesser succesful marvel films . and still none of them have been nominated for best picture . say what you will , but the level of quality in the dc films is almost undeniable lower than the marvel films . it pains me to say that too , because when it comes to the comics i actually lean more towards dc . but they have next to no idea what they ' re doing when it comes to films these days .

7. my point is that theres a legal limit on how drunk you can be and drive , if you are below that limit you can drive . for most people , having two drinks puts them below that limit .

8. this is not entirely true . it is in my case . but for the majority of people , they decide to screw around for fun and suddenly become addicted . i don ' t even have an addictive personality , i just like how drugs feel .

10. first off , i like the thinking behind this and it was really well thought out . however i think i  d have to disagree with this . i feel like euphoria is trying to be as original as it can . they make it like no other show that i know of , and i feel like they are creating their own plot . but if this is some version of romeo and juliet , i wouldn  t necessarily be mad about itexcept for the fact that fez would die plz no .

11. fuck i loved this game as a kid , when you go back to play it as an adult you realise how much drugs  psychedelics influenced the level designs .

12. it is bad in many moments like how the monsters look and that many characters look kinda dollish . what bothered me most were the nipples . the fight scenes still looked great in my opinion and the important characters didn ' t look worse than what you get in your usual anime

13. i personally find it strange that people are more okay with sex toys than pipes commonly used for cannabis , though marketed toward tobacco . i can ' t even begin to understand how the sale of glass would upset someone wanting to buy a black rubber dong . i understand the struggle though . i would talk to the people in my local head shop and the managers and owners would always complain about how the city council and madd mothers against drunk driving and other organizations would always complain about them and try to get them shut down . thank you for the answer , though i am not happy about the reality of the answer i truly do appreciate the insight .

14. i have come to know it is tf2 characters apparently

15. I live in for tim/steve banter.

16. i ' ve always been a fan of star wars , but my parents would only let me watch the ot and the phantom menace ? eventually i learned most of what happened in the other movies from lego star wars  the complete saga or the clone wars , so i never got around to watching them before now . i understood the context of the memes and , tbh , the cult  y  ness of this sub was entertaining enough for me to subscribe . now it holds much deeper meaning . i love it .

17. i was put off by the new animation style at first elitist 80s  90s kid here so i had always ignored it . the few clips i saw of ahsoka made me think she was annoying too . it wasn ' t until i noticed all the seasons on netflix last month that i thought to myself " ok dipshit , time to stop being stubborn " and i began watching them in season order . i realized they weren ' t chronological so i found the proper order and it ' s been very , very entertaining . i always have these moments where i prove myself wrong about not liking something but i never learn . the one thing i really appreciate about this series is how it humanizes anakin and even though he still has the rebellious streak , he doesn ' t come off as the whiney version of anakin that you want to slap . it actually made me a bit sad that you know he will eventually turn , because he ' s pretty likable in tcw .

18. i can understand that . so tom is still in denial about leaving the bandwhich i mean he probably still owns it unless mark bought him out and was talking in an interview awhile back about wanting to bring blink under his production company and let them make music as they please and all that stuff . so idk im interested to see the state of the band and were it goes on in the next few years with them if tom really does still own parts of it and stuff . kinda suck to see matt get kicked to the curb though if he comes back .

19. a this is up for speculation . some people believe it was a production error , but others believe it was intentional to give the idea that if these things happened in the future , then there ' s still time to make a difference in the lives of people like hannah . is not a definitive answer . it leave is open to discussion . isn ' t the point of this subreddit to discussion topics like this ?

20. i think it  s pretty obvious that they have grown to a point that they need to follow the money . you can  t blame them but for every single feature that doesn  t drive revenue requires capital . with plex pad not being essential for all users , they literally have a zero rmr driving product that said , you can  t expect endless resources to come from nowhere . the options are   people pay more for what they get to allow them to ease up on other methods of generating revenue  let them get some revenue driving streams so they can soon offer the features they likely need money to develop .  or digit , find something better . right now , they are not as customer hungry as they are capital hungry so they gotta do what they gotta do this is all simply my opinion on all the recent whining about not getting what people want . it  s still leaps and bounds ahead of anything out there
