5. thanks so much ! it sounds like you guys are doing great , awesome job ! my only advice is to never quit . you will have times when you binge or completely abandon your diet and eat those high calorie , high fat foods . when this happens step back on the path and return to your diet and do so without shame or embarrassment . weight loss is not a race it ' s a destination , it matters not how fast you go as long as you get there smiling  face  with  smiling  eyes

10. gillian , i just loved your performance in bleak house . you were amazing in that . such a subtle heart  breaking character sketch . i thought , " that is the best uk accent i have ever heard an american do . i later found out you lived in the uk as a child and like john barrowman , were pressured to change it when you went to live in the us . which do you feel is your ' natural ' accent or like jb , does the one you use change depending on who you talk to ? do you prefer working in the uk or the us ? i for one really think you ' ve come into your peak since working in the uk . and you ' ve never looked more beautiful . and thank you for being an inspiration to smart , feisty girls around the world . you ' re awesome .

15. that i just applied for a  10k  loan that will be looming over me for the foreseeable future in hopes of not washing out of college and getting a job good enough to pay of for the loan plus interest in an extremely competitive society that is only growing more cutthroat by the day . college is fun .
