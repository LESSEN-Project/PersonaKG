1. that ' s a fuckin ' cop out if i ever heard one . otherwise you wouldn ' t be hiding your affairs from your spouse . time for a divorce . that ' s pretty obvious .
   (ID: 5a15ed606a86674cb48abaf9fee4375ff6bbff09)

2. anytime . there ' s also the amount of alcohol he drank to consider . honestly i ' ve thought about getting a squad for my roommates over that alone . a bottle of jameson is a lot of liquor , i don ' t care how much you weigh . whatever you decide to do , keep yourself safe . i hope it goes well . do not let him back into your life after this . you ' re through with this fuckin scrub , and you have better things awaiting you .

3. aside from obvious signs such as abuse , look for subtle psychological abusive things like how the family interacts together . if a lot of times they are together with an attitude of only because i have to be here is a flag to look for , especially if they don ' t enjoy each other ' s company . other things to look for is how they talk about each other when they ' re not with each other  if it ' s all bad  mouthing or lack of respect , concern , or true love that too is surely a bad sign .

4. i think both of your family members have valid points . good idea , for legal reasons if assets are being divided , to wait until the divorce is final . it  s easy to see a random normal person as amazing if you  ve been in a shit relationship for awhile , which it sounds like you has . you know what you  re feeling though . your call .

5. you ' re making this hard for me aren ' t you . i fear going to a therapist . my dad thinks that i am just an ungrateful teenager that thinks i can have anything . i had cuts on the wrong side of my wrist because i feared death for some reason and wanted to get used to the pain so i could end it finally but unfortunately my dad found out and that was the most terrible experience in my life . i just feared to do something . he was mad at me but also calm . still asking me questions . i won ' t seek help . i ' ll be alive but . " just an empty shell walking around " and i ' m fine with it kinda . i . guess . yeah listen . it ' s kinda simply to say to listen to advices . i tried to do the same . force her to listen to me so she would feel better and won ' t end it . i ' ve got no proof that i saved her but i believe her .

6. replaced her toothpaste with sanitize .
   (ID: 016485853897f1b9f422dd4da7d83e7e4a5261b0)

7. yea , leave in a goid way offer to help with transition of task to other person . you never know , you might need their help in the future .
   (ID: 3c4a38138d39bd51556bd7f8a05ba48bf283c7e6)

8. okay he is being a little unfair by saying that it won ' t work , if you haven ' t tried it , neither of you will know . and also , if it doesn ' t work , just go back i know there are financial complications with that , but mental health is always first . you can always make more money , you can be un  sad if you know what i mean . sometimes it ' s jot about physically being away , but mentally being away . one great thing i have with my current partner we ' ve lived together and apart several times  very unreliable with money haha we can sit with each other in silence and it ' s okay , or just say " i ' m not feeling talking or doing anything " i know it ' s hard because when you love someone you want to be with them , and it feels like you ' re being mean if you don ' t want to be there all the time . but it ' s normal . try and give yourself some more attention , when you look after yourself , many things in life fall into place . your whole brain restructures , certain things become unimportant etc etc

9. the reason for my hefty amount into saving is because i wanna start building some equity at my young age and steady pay , but would you say it  s better to put more money into retirement or assets ?
   (ID: b2c623940e1acb4e269cab1c8f1920e03da9e429)

10. if you can come up with a name you both like , it would be nice if you changed it together so you have that connection even though , like you say , a name doesn ' t equal family , but it ' s a nice thing to have in common . if you ' re serious about changing your first name too , have a look at lists there are plenty online or ask around i ' m sure people here would be happy to give you suggestions . pretty soon you ' ll work out which styles and sounds you like and dislike . i ' d also recommend having a look at the top 100ish names for the year you were born and maybe a few other years from around that time as a starting point , that way you ' ll know if you want something in  keeping with your generation or something a bit more unusual .

11. this is cheating . you should ' ve had a sit down , in  depth conversation with him . most likely , you mentioned it in passing when you knew he wouldn ' t be actively listening and used that to justify your actions . i don ' t believe for a second you weren ' t trying to be in some way sneaky about it . even in your post , you use the fact that " well , lots of other people do it too " as though other people ' s actions have any impact on that ' s acceptable in your relationship . you ' re married . you two must ' ve discussed what cheating meant prior to getting married . you cheated .

12. because they are angry and frustrated that things aren ' t going the way the want them to go with op . they express their frustration by slamming doors since , a constructive dialog hasn ' t happened for a long time . there have been only shouting , blaming and anger . op you should just bake some cookies and invited your roommate for some tee and talk about bettering your living situation . when you both work hard on yourself you can improve the life of yours and those around you . or just put a bucket of wood glue on top his door , heat up his door handle while he sleeps or just lock his door from outside , when he slams it again , until he has starved so much he will be sorry for his behavior and won ' t do it again .

13. sounds like someone really hated that whole family . maybe more than one person , poison and dynamite  bombs are very different weapon choices . it seems weird that she would lean over looking at the package for an extended period of time instead of just picking it up like most people would . i guess she could have been extra cautious because of the dynamite at her brother  in  law ' s place but if she was suspicious , why not call the police to come and look at it ?

14. dont worry i gotchu fam , see im digit myself and i have a gf who likes to show off skin obviously not nude . anyways if it was a real concern id explain to her one last time that if makes you uncomfortable seeing another guy is getting pictures of her with only a towel on . if shes sending you spicer pics then id see this as less of a concern anyways if this still continues ask for her friends what they think try to get them on your side and from there just ask them to help you convince her to stop . if this still doesnt do anything ask for an ultimatum this is a last resort . ultimatums work digit  of time because it makes the other feel trapped and stuck with an a question thatll change the course of the relationship . if the ultimatum succeeds be extremely nice to the other person otherwise theyll think they made the wrong decision . if otherwise then there are plenty of fish in the sea . let me know what you end up doung because im actually interested

15. just don ' t , be blunt and explain why , hopefully you ' re all adults and can understand the explanation .
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

16. if she ' s insisting but let you pay the other times , let her this time . i dated a guy for awhile who paid for every single thing , which is super flattering , but when i told my mom she was like " you need to pay too ! just make him let you pay " so i felt weird about it . we are told we need to take care of ourselves first , to be independent , that we can ' t be " bought " etc . i think it ' s actually a good sign on her feelings towards you . while i ' m not dating that guy anymore , i offered a lot to pay because i didn ' t want him to think i was taking advantage of his kindness . i did finally end up paying for a few things here and there , which worked out because he never carried cash and i ' m a cash girl . i doubt this will be the new " rule " where she will always pay for herself .

17. you should marry for finances and children , but it won  t work if you do not love the other person , or if you aren  t smart which usually is the case these days , nobody seems to use their brain
   (ID: bcaa247be9d3b5a702098c9ffea4721d09504809)

18. fuck no don ' t let her be one of your bridesmaid ' s i ' d tell rebecca exactly how you feel and why you ' re not letting her be one of your bridesmaid ' s and leave it at that this is your day , don ' t let anyone ruin it for you in any way
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

19. you  re not in the wrong . who wants to sleep around with a girl who might have stds ? even if she doesn  t , bragging about how many guys you  ve had sex with isn  t really impressive , it makes you look like a whore . he  s not slut shaming , he  s being smart .
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

20. hahaha nah your good bro . you just signed the incident report . it most likely just said the events that took place . one thing to remember , never admit guilt ! " i dunno why that dog sat , maybe he ' s broken ? " humor goes along way in all confrontations .
