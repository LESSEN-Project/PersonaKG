3. to the hypos reading this , understand that these ridiculous stories of people going from a common cold to dead are extremely rare instances . it is highly more likely what you eat is slowly killing you , so if you ' re so worried about dying a slow painful death you should take action now .

4. pasta . would actually be a blessing to not have the ability to eat it anymore . so much easier to quit something when you have no choice .

12. they aren ' t " only supposed to drink milk " i mean at first , yes technically but that isn ' t why . babies will get full on water and refuse to eat , basically starving themselves to death . i ' m so glad you think parenting is easy . please save this post so you can read it when your child reaches digit years . it ' s way too early for you to be making a huge deal out of having a child , especially if you are so entitled you think you can threaten someone ' s well being just to get what you want . will you threaten to kick your child out when they don ' t clean their room fast enough ? it ' s not so much about age . it ' s about how to speak , view the world and respond to it with such . violence . give me what i want or i ' ll put you in danger , but not directly .

15. you are getting someone  else to kill for you for fun . vegan food is nasty but you didn ' t kill an animal to get it . you are killing out of preference rather than necessity . do you have a problem understanding words ?
   (ID: 98df62eadd0a0c80a6084d5e352985209b46cce9)

16. i was being facetious about the " afternoon snack " thing but i ' m gonna just say that all bets are off if a momma thinks their baby is in danger and leave it at that .

18. in asian cooking there is no universal brand that is good for all things , most brands become famous for the digit or digit sauces they make and expand into other sauces which they make not so well . also consider ingredients differ from country to country so for example thai rice flour is different from korean rice flour and different from japanese rice flour although all being just called " rice flour " on the package because the rice they eat is slightly different . this is the same with sauces for example chinese black bean sauce is not the same as korean black bean sauce . so if you truly want to know how to cook asian food well , you have to first have authentic regional asian food cooked for you . then you can try to replicate it yourself by experimenting with sauces and whatnot . that said , you can mix and match and have it taste good to yourself , just don ' t feed it to some korean girl and expect she won ' t spit it out in front of you .
