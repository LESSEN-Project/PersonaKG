   (ID: 6b905bd3ce93b272b7759cc36bdf2d5114dc18c1)

3. sorry , what exactly is this unpardonable sin ? and why do you think you committed it ? and what would be the very worst thing to happen to you if you did ? and how likely do you think that very worst thing is realistically going to happen ? are you maybe experiencing some cognitive distortions about your guilt here ? if you  re concerned your god is going to send you to hell for some sin , you probably need to speak to a christian counselor or pastor . they  ll have the answers you  re looking for . and side note , i  m not a christian but a lot of family are . i don  t know what sin could possibly be unpardonable .

   (ID: bfe383e709c2236b3ebe70cb079877dd420ac82b)

6. just tell them you are on new medication and that you passed out and now that you know this side effect , you will be talking to your doctor to fix it .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

7. i think not just parent , people love to think that if you think you are sick that somehow makes you sick . i do understand power of the mind ect . most of the time however if you think you ' re sick . your sick . don ' t take risks with your health you could be allergic to something , or have a fungus infection in your nose . i recommend op see his local ent specialist asap .

8. i can completely relate to the " someone " always being the ow . or any notification on his phone must be her . unfortunately i ' m not in a situation where he seems digit  committed back to me . so i ' m really struggling with what to do next . i think i know what i have to do but i really don ' t want to . something that has helped me is counseling . i am hoping to switch to  add on an mft to talk to as well , specifically for this problem . and my friends always remind me that i am loved and am worthy of love .

10. no matter the circumstances there are people out there who really care about you and your well being
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

11. thanks for your comments , no worries at all , i appreciate your question a lot . in many ways , yes i " thank " myself for my life , in the sense that i respect myself and want to live my best life . as such , i have made good decisions , chosen my friends well and am surrounded by good people because i chose that for myself . but my gratitude goes beyond myself and those around me .

12. yta and the fact that even after being told explicitly why thousands of times and hearing your brothers feelings , you still think you  re in the right , only proves he  s better off without you in his life . you  re homophobic , your fiancee is homophobic . telling someone you love they can  t come to your wedding because their existence would bother other people is just about the worst thing you could do . just because you are  nice  about it doesn  t mean you  re a nice person . god forbid you have a gay kid .

13. well i ' m sorry you had those experiences , but i feel like people tend to notice and remember bad things far more prominently than nice things , maybe something to do with it ? i don ' t think basic kindness is gone , i think it ' s more that with all the horrible shit in the media we keep being bombarded with , it ' s easier for people to just shut off . maybe all people need to do is to work on regaining their sense of compassion . either way , hope you manage to surround yourself with nice people in future

14. fine ty , sorry didn ' t see this one . i hope your well !
   (ID: 555615a7b22f65cadd2e223e2e891e540623f3a4)

15. please keep fighting ! some thing that i am doing to keep going is making a list and adding to it every day of things that i would miss out if i weren  t here anymore
   (ID: 23db574d60be3ebd64ccd49ceb2b7a6ca7eff040)

16. as someone who is bisexual and hasn  t told her parents , i don  t think it  s relevant unless you start seeing someone . i know it  s a huge part of a person  s identity , but i don  t see any reason to damage your relationship with your parents unless it  s going to benefit another relationship . does that make sense ? in my case , my friends know , my fiance knows , but i  ve never sat down with my parents and talked to them about it .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

17. he will find his own way . my sister still has a relationship with them but i am nc with my parents . it  s weird sometimes . but that  s what works for her and this is what works for me , and that  s ok . just give him hugs , and be there for him , because we have to choose our family very carefully  we were given such crappy ones ! sounds like you both are on the same page . and don  t ever give your ssn to anyone who asks . god , so many horror stories of nparents stealing their children  s identities and ruining their lives ! aack ! protect yourself !

18. you ok over there ?
   (ID: f67daf28a38187108da9b380f2e2f9336016c584)

19. wow well look at you being all happy . how dare you ? you think the rest of us are gonna be as lucky as you with our crushes ? no need to rub it in , christ ! nah just kidding , congrats man
