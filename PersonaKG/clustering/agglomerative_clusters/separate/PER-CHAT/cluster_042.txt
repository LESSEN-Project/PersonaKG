3. an injury  free and professional neymar is priceless , but this isn ' t the version that barca are getting at the moment , and barto should realize this . what guarantee is there that ney won ' t start sulking if he gets benched by griezmann or dembele and start publically courting real madrid or city ?   x200b  plus , barca , like psg , need neymar to be fit for the cl , and if he gets injured  suspended once again around the time of this sister ' s birthday , he would probably be worthless for barca . he sucker punched barca digit years back , prolonged his stay to collect a bonus , and hardly left barca any time to get a replacement . barca have already bought griezzmann and de jong . so how much can they spend in subsequent windows if they splurge money on neymar next season ? players like busquets , rakitic , pique and vidal may need to be replaced soon .

6. i went to scis pd , graduated digit . if you played basketball or volleyball , we would have met . i went to the us and studied information systems , graduated in digit . i did opt for a year before realizing i couldn ' t stay long term . now i ' m in canada doing a graduate diploma . i really want to go back to the us , and honestly , my best chance now is marriage . once i ' m done with my studies in canada , i ' m hoping to get another student visa back to the us , and marry an american . work visas are a nightmare , and even if you get sponsored , there ' s no guarantee you ' ll be issued one . i ' m sure you know about the process . i was like you , i had no idea how difficult the process was until i started my opt . i was so naive , all i did was go to school and went about my business , but i had no idea the consequences of my actions or inaction . hope you find what you ' re looking for . i want to settle in the us permanently , and i ' m hoping everything will work out fine .

8. doubt it . it  s hard to catch stocks at their bottom . and their track record seems to suggest they  ll keep making mistakes . if anthem takes off it could be a good bump for them though . there are better choices for undervalued stock out there , like baba

12. so no debt from college and free healthcare , plus  42k a year net income ? that ' s not bad . my question would be is it even worth trying to excel in your job and get promoted and a raise because even if you got to  84k with the tax rate you ' d probably be making the same net income , right ?

18. the health check needs to be done at an official provider of marriage license health checks , it can ' t be done at just any hospital . in saigon , it is cho ray hospital . you need a specific form , and passport photos of specific size . it ' s not a fun experience . all documents from the foreign non  vietnamese party must be translated into vietnamese at the official people ' s committee translation desk   in saigon this is located near diamond plaza , iirc . this includes passport , and proof of single status usually an affadavit that one gets from his or her embassy . if either party has been married before , sorry , now you have to also provide official divorce papers . if it is the non  viet party , these divorce papers will also need to be notarized and authenticated by a high level of government in the home country . all forms that you fill out must be in block letters , and the smallest mistake will not be noticed until they ' ve been " processing " the form for digit months , at which point they ' ll hand it back with the mistake , and you get to start over and wait another two months . as hinted above , the forms and procedures cannot be handed in at one time . they are done in stages and each stage comes with a ridiculous waiting period in between . as others have said , if you have the  digit   digit that an agent will charge to do it all for you , quickly , it ' s totally worth the money .
