8. i want to die now

9. my favorite book series is the dresden files by jim butcher . the quality of the first couple books isn ' t great , so i recommend starting with dead beat book digit in the series . that will give you a feel for what the series as a whole is like , and if you like it , then go back and start from book digit .

10. star wars knights of the old republic , hands down . one of the greatest games i ' ve ever fucking played . i was on the old xbox original playing that every morning before school and i genuinely think a remake would be bigger than gta v .

11. unless you have risk factors for hiv i ' d say you might be freaking out for no reason . as someone who was a hypochondriac for a long time   and i ' m not claiming that you are   i have experience with freaking out over symptoms . for now , accept the fact that you ' re having some symptoms of " something " but also accept the fact that you are a not a medical professional and b that the symptoms you ' ve described could be a million things , digit  of which are harmless , will go away on their own , or if not are easily treatable . wait until your checkup . no use worrying about something that may be nothing . as always if you have life threatening symptoms go see a doctor right away .

12. i highly recommend getting the nathan drake collection for ps4 that has the first digit games on it . you can decide for yourself which is your favorite but they all have a lot of great moments and it ' s worth playing from the start just to see how nate  elena met .
   (ID: a18adc4ad3b28b34dfa3063a1c77566b8681a79d)

13. i played both and honestly i would have been a really difficult choice god of war makes you feel badass when you  re slaughtering thing 10x your size and the story is great . red dead  s story is very captivating and emotional and the open world of it is absolutely beautiful . i personally would say red dead deserved it a smidge more but both are absolute masterpieces in which i  ve had the pleasure of playing also arthur isok  handjust so good .
