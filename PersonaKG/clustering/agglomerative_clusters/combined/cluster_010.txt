1. just because it ' s his house doesn ' t mean he ' s not an asshole . he gave no mind to his future pil and their dept . he ' s being an irresponsible child . i ' d appreciate it if you gave a counter argument so you can ellaborate you ' re point an important meta you should readhttps

   (ID: 1df1bd07e28c0df73bd865f8cb447d7c8f1bd4d3)

4. i ' m not trying to defend him but don ' t you think someone might have already redeemed it and you later decided to check it out only to find out it ' s gone ? it ' s happened to me many times for free steam keys in discussion tabs
   (ID: 43361d3d352286328dcb058ec017ca0e2d364601)

5. probably nothing and i ' m so sad about it . last year we found this really amazing resturaunt that we really liked but it ' s kinda far . so i had hoped to make it our thing to continue going to it every year for valentine ' s day . i also made a clay mold of my hand giving the finger and did it up all nice . it ' s like an inside joke thing and i know he would have loved it so much . so now it ' s just sitting in my room waiting to never be received by the person it was made for . minda wanna destroy it and smash it to pieces because im so mad and upset .

7. i honestly don ' t think he needs any rework , if you are looking for a counter , hold still during the duration of his drone . it ' s that simple . if you get rushed and have to move then that was probably the point of the activation of the done .

9. does anyone , anyone , know the back story of this ? had he jumped over that fence before ? or did he land like that before and tried to do it again which would definitely be a dumb move , or was it just a first time thing ? i did dumb stuff to be funny or cool and so did my friends , but . this ? i ' m just trying to figure out what the thought was here .
   (ID: 4c696d3f1d19d74a8b9e25c3dddb75deefc97a4b)

10. let him sit and watch tv all day . ask him what he likes . tell him stories about the two of you and your favorite show  time together . listen to any of his stories , even if they are ridiculous . don ' t expect anything from him , so when he does remember it will be a gift . rotate caregivers frequently to avoid burnout . check out local care facilities , cost , and requirements . join a support group .
