7. well i suppose that ' s probably how a lot of the great stand  up comedians and voice actors started . i ' ll admit , doing it in front of strangers is probably going to be more nerve  wracking . i do some voices and crack jokes around people i know but i already know where i stand with them . doing it to get strangers to like me or to put food on the table would make me more nervous .
   (ID: ab9a3fa39c7ebd1066697c2d7027afe2422d5ac7)

8. it ' s sounds like my well executed life plan . we may not get there the same way as everyone else , but we ' ll have some interesting stories about the journey .

11. the title would probably be called , " slice of light . " the plot o my movie would probably just be the story of my life , focusing on minor issues with my life like failing a test . i would probably be narrating over different parts of the story , similar to tfs ' story of trunks . it would probably have some parts very brief , the parts that i dont remember very well , and the vivid memories would be very detailed and exaggerated . an example of this would be when my parents told me that we were bnb going to move . it would end with the present  me on winter break with my family , in the eighth grade .
   (ID: 3ad18913fe75fd4a63c4ae0d0255c37d90fd7144)
