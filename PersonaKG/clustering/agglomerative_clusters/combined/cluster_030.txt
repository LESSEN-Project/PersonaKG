Total from this dataset: 657

1. at a dinner party , i asked a couple good friends how they met . one of them dumped the other to date my so for a year and then they got back together . everyone in the damn room apparently knew because they all just stared at me like i was crazy . my so never told me this shit .
   (ID: 0861712f8592c280471770109eb434101eb06dca)

2. i know this is an old meme but still a better love story than twilight
   (ID: 87921f4850625bbc1ea70e7a3027781ab887303e)

3. yep . taught me what love is .
   (ID: 32b13ea4ca437349e9a1e08776a6ff36cef70328)

4. i don ' t have experience with cheating parents or spouses , at least not that i ' m aware . i do agree with you that is wrong and harmful to both women . however , if i were in your shoes , i would have to ask myself some questions . first , what do you want to accomplish by speaking with your mom ? you clearly cannot change her behavior by talking to her about it , as you have tried that . secondly , what kind , if any , relationship do you want with her ? if you intervene in some way call the wife , confront the man , etc , you will be further alienating your mom . and lastly , can you live with this knowledge and not intervene if that is the only way to save your relationship with your mother ? if you answer these questions honestly and with great contemplation or not rashly , i believe you will know what course you should take . good luck !
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

5. if she ' s insisting but let you pay the other times , let her this time . i dated a guy for awhile who paid for every single thing , which is super flattering , but when i told my mom she was like " you need to pay too ! just make him let you pay " so i felt weird about it . we are told we need to take care of ourselves first , to be independent , that we can ' t be " bought " etc . i think it ' s actually a good sign on her feelings towards you . while i ' m not dating that guy anymore , i offered a lot to pay because i didn ' t want him to think i was taking advantage of his kindness . i did finally end up paying for a few things here and there , which worked out because he never carried cash and i ' m a cash girl . i doubt this will be the new " rule " where she will always pay for herself .
   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

6. does she feel even close to how i do ?
   (ID: e1aebf37580e679f77f5038c575f4359c51af29f)

7. well , you don ' t bring it up on a first date . just show her during foreplay .
   (ID: 6227692d2c261d0ca079ff0b4b03c8c2a6933b88)

8. okay he is being a little unfair by saying that it won ' t work , if you haven ' t tried it , neither of you will know . and also , if it doesn ' t work , just go back i know there are financial complications with that , but mental health is always first . you can always make more money , you can be un  sad if you know what i mean . sometimes it ' s jot about physically being away , but mentally being away . one great thing i have with my current partner we ' ve lived together and apart several times  very unreliable with money haha we can sit with each other in silence and it ' s okay , or just say " i ' m not feeling talking or doing anything " i know it ' s hard because when you love someone you want to be with them , and it feels like you ' re being mean if you don ' t want to be there all the time . but it ' s normal . try and give yourself some more attention , when you look after yourself , many things in life fall into place . your whole brain restructures , certain things become unimportant etc etc
   (ID: 87d1924873eb8926aac7c71d1a563d7d2d1cabbd)

9. don ' t wanna over  pry but any particular reason you stayed with these guys if you weren ' t super into them ? or was it just early on in the relationship so there wasn ' t an attachment yet ?
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

10. you ' re taking the cowards way out by ghosting him after saying you ' d give him a second chance . you should practice saying what you mean and meaning what you say . people might like you more
   (ID: 34f6590800ca7e82ee6e0964dfd9b74e7bcde48f)

11. how you get them is how you lose them . why would you think that he would be faithful to you ? i ' m pretty sure he ' s reassuring you the same way he reassured her .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

12. first and foremost you ' re doing great already . to some extent a stubborn stressed woman in the third tri is going to require you to roll with a lot of punches no matter what . it ' s entirely possible that what she needs most sometimes , fair or not , is a punching bag to let off some of the steam she has to keep repressed with nearly everyone in her life . my best advice otherwise , try proving to her you ' re doing what you can by getting her to expound on her feelings rather than trying to refute them . she says you ' re not stepping up to the plate ? fine , instead of arguing , ask what you could do better . write the list down , check the items off or at least make progress on them and report back within a couple weeks and ask the same question after . it ' s not a contest or a way to show her up , it ' s an exercise to show in an enumerable way that you ' re doing the best you can not just to be a dad in general , but to address her specific stress points . it ' s important that it not become a contest of any sort . you may have to do it over and over , or different variants for different issues but if you can show her that you ' re addressing her specific concerns instead of just doing what you believe to be responsible which is great , again i applaud your efforts and preparedness it can go a long way to relieving some of her stress on that specific issue , proving commitment to her and validating her feelings .
   (ID: c97109aa4490f066338d606215716cd658a4cb30)

13. when you feel like you are living with a roommate versus someone you are in love with .
   (ID: 13773c5692e9c83c78b055c57cb682df4ef2654b)

14. i asked what ' s the worst part . as in there ' s a lot of bad parts .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

15. let  s overshadow your  s with my success , kinda . i asked and we went on a date , one time , and she  s legitimately been busy every other time i  ve asked .
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

16. i just get fuckin annoyed and then you say something and their like awww someone ' s jealous like bitch i ' ll see you in a month when ricky cheats on you
   (ID: 590fa4d9757be797407857020a0aa2aa0f4ad290)

17. never had a problem with not clicking . just them thinking im going to continue to buy them stuff . i find some girls want the benefits of being a gf without the work . it isn ' t the idea of getting shot down it ' s women play games . they will lead a guy on . but i wouldnt bitch and mope . i would just ghost on them .
   (ID: d6e89a045ccd97a556ff87527d8a08a8e3c89fc1)

18. delete the number , or block the number . make it extremely difficult to get in contact with him in anyway . know what he did to you and know how you felt when you found out . do you really wanna feel that way again ? you deserve to be happy and putting yourself in that situation is going to dig yourself into a deep hole . dont give him the satisfaction of cheating on a girl and then having her run back to him . it will make him a worse person and it will only hurt you in the end .
   (ID: ea1aba6f5a01e142602653a1b9987c70e3862a45)

19. felt boobs . got great big boner w  bubble on the end . hetero confirmed .
   (ID: 2e0fa1fd581de25802392d764f2cae20411f0e12)

20. nta you ' re actually being very reasonable . you don ' t wanna end it just because she ' s digit , but because she lied and her biologicl clock puts some strain on your life plans . it ' s a new relationship and i can confirm that you ' ll move on and find somebody who suits you better
