9. thanks for asking . it ' s pretty interesting ! so asperger ' s syndrome as is like basically not understanding social stuff . and one trademark sign is lack of eye contact . and hypo  hypersensitivity to . senses . another thing is people with as take things like expressions very literally which i also often do . so missing out on social cues for me was explained by probably having some kind of attention disorder . i don ' t see social cues because i zone out all the time and am not even aware of them happening . lack of eye contact was partially attention related , and partially anxiety  related . less social skills when talking was also anxiety  related and because i ' m shy  introverted generally . because i would isolate myself from people and and never really developed them in the first place i guess . then it ' s also partially because i ' m just kinda weird and think about things in a completely different way than most people usually do . and i also coincidentally am hyposensitive to things . when i went into the appointment , at the beginning they said they were almost completely certain that they would give me a diagnosis by the end . but by the end they said i couldn ' t have it because my body language , while sometimes non  existent , it was also sometimes there even if not that great . and the main point of contention was i had friends when i was a kid . so my lack of friends later on in life was like just due to nurture rather than nature if you know what i mean . so i ' m not any less screwed really but i technically don ' t have asperger ' s since i didn ' t have that particular problem from birth lol

14. as a kid , hell . i was the youngest , so i was constantly picked on , and my parents would tell me " don ' t provoke them " even when i hadn ' t done anything . they also acted like if one of us knew something , we should all know it , even though some of us had way less experience  education than the others . and yes , parents have favorites , and it makes the others feel inferior as shit . as an adult , we stopped fighting and now it ' s like we ' re friends that will never grow distant , even if we don ' t see each other for ages .
