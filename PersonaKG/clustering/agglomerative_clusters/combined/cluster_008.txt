1. i did not realize this would start just a big discussion haha . i decided to give an example of something that i just found about digit minutes ago to ensure no bias i have not read this fanfiction , i just searched  one direction fan fiction  and this was the second one i found .  i ' m megan and i live in a foster home with a bitchy nanny , i ' ve been here since i was digit and i have never been adopted . i , digit . yay . my best friend is abused by the nanny and bullied . oh , i am too .  first of all  i , digit . yay .  an iconic sentence that has me in tears . second , ? third , this was the second thing to come up and it  s digit and under the general tag one direction , you can imagine just how much fan fiction there is under this tag . obviously it  s not the worst detail that can be in fan fiction but it  s just so juvenile . before you judge me  i do not exclusively read one direction fan fiction honestly haven  t read any since maybe digit . i  ve seen this cliche of unnecessary character introductions including details that are irrelevant in many fandoms  star wars , that 70s show , etc . i do however feel that the one direction fandom was infiltrated by digit year olds beating the mary sue mold to death and fans became accustomed to it but it was always bugged me because i just alway say babe i don  t want to give you sympathy right now you just introduced yourself and the first thing you say is  hey there i  m      i have brown hair and my parents died when i was digit  like ? you don  t go around introducing yourself like that . that  s my two cents take em or leave em

2. One of my favorite things is japanese commercials.
   (ID: 8e22144947225f2bd7d950ea1b4044909a8653ae)

3. since what a fursona is has been explained to death here i ' ll just add to it first , you do not need a fursona to be a furry . in general " being furry " is a very loose term . the only thing in common between all of us is that we like anthropomorphic art . however if you do want to interact with the community outside of reddit having at least an oc as an avatar will help tremendously . second , hya reddit is the best place imo . stay here if you want amazing furry art regularly oand go to furry  irl some nsfw , not a lot for memes and shitposting .

8. its from mashiroiro symphony , i don ' t remember the exact quote , i don ' t care , but its something to the effect of  having pets is scary because you know they ' ll die before you , but when they do its important to remember the fun you had while they were alive not the pain of losing them .

15. the first time i played runescape i was a total noob i knew nothing about the game at all and i was rather young i was atrocious at the game and i remember sitting at the castle that i cant remember the name of when a dude came up and offered to teach me the game he was so patient it took me like digit minutes to do something rather simple and he was just so patient to this day i wish i knew who that mystery man was we played for like digit  digit hours and he helped me all the way and was rather patient .

16. do you mean ' safe for work ' as apposed to nsfw ? if so does it have to be at work ? because i guess that would be this old guy john i used to work a sales counter with yelling " please stop ! " to an old lady walking into the show room that was about to walk over a piece of paper that had fallen on the floor , so he thought she would slip . she walked over it like it was nothing before looking up at him and starting to sign in sign language . because she was def . and therefor did not hear this old guy scream so loud his face turned beat red , and everyone that worked in that huge building heard and came over , but she didn ' t really pay attention so she didnt know what happened and no one told her lol . thats the sfw story i go to when talking to family or kids or whatever . idk if thats what your looking for .
