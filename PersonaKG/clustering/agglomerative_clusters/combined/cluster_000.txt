1. i read that as corned beef and nearly puked . i mainly eat irish beef , i guess it doesnt need to travel as far . meat in the us could probably spend a few days in transit and being moved around more . the more you think about it the more differences could contribute but i think youre probably right about personal  cultural taste .
   (ID: 37f1dd54cc7fbf9961db909e5dce33ca94dc5b82)

   (ID: 7d48334cb8c79d90b96048b0f085563eb847ba89)

6. a loving and caring girl gently dominating her sad boy .
   (ID: be642743472cdef9445edc6dd55beb3c2a8a1258)

7. basically yea , they ' re better for fantasies and sex . most the women that look like that get surgery because they have self esteem , and low confidence , or some other mental problem . but that doesn ' t make them any less physically attractive though lol . if i were to cuff a chick it ' d would be a regular woman that doesn ' t have all those enhancements
   (ID: 2e30252ab6ce4c1807bb315c6103be324b841909)

10. hard avocado . so many more days of waiting for it to ripen . soft apple is doable but it ' s very disappointing .
   (ID: ed8c4bb1975edb0f627baa6dac44e74cbc7237c6)

11. there are some foods that need to be cooked that are otherwise toxic , quinoa for example . the ' cooking destroys nutrients ' thesis , although often true is irrelevant . you can eat eat a greater quantity of steamed broccoli and recieve the same amount of micronutrients as a smaller quantity of raw brocolli
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

12. would you like to explain to me why you don  t find an entire race attractive instead of getting angry ? or is that a sign you have no rebuttal because i  m right ?
   (ID: 2401680976bbdfe87278659ff11173d22161b22d)

13. this one  s a tough one . i can kind of see where the wife is coming from , your dad could afford 10k for one brother  s house deposit but 2k for the other is a hard no ? it does sound a bit unfair , but at the same time i get that the dad doesn  t owe you the money and since you don  t see it as him playing favourites she shouldn  t be mad on your behalf . calling her entitled and spoiled is kinda rude though , especially when it seems that she  d have no problem being turned down if the brother had been too .
   (ID: 46d8e69cfbec2948bee8eaeaf91010f2e7f16e4b)

14. yeah , but the largest reason for wet dreams is that your body has produced more semen than it needs , it then has to get rid of the old semen by disposing of it . sending it through to the penis
   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

15. would you get off on watching your parents do that ?
   (ID: b4d61ff0c23f7ce5512ee9f64d1bea0f938f262a)

16. you know what , i  m gonna play devils advocate here and say if you really truly genuinely mean it and are willing to face the repercussions , say  in love with  . saying  i love      is thrown around far too much and has started to lose meaning
   (ID: 52998b8f3de02e095d5ef2887f1b1c9122825175)

17. they  ve already subconsciously deemed me as hookup material just off my looks alone . how full of yourself do you have to be to believe you are too good looking for men to want a relationship with you . you proved my point  digit .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

18. currently they ' re being skeptical but haven ' t taken any further actions to both of you i mean like deducting pay or giving warnings , have they ? i think if they start to do so then present the records
   (ID: a04ffec23ab9c2af8d4ac433e06db2b5d1b4bf9b)

19. employers are required to give you the option to keep your heath insurance after you part ways  you agreed to this health insurance isn ' t like car insurance . you paid your premiums every month while working , it ' s the same after employment separation  monthly  digit for health insurance covering a digit month period is totally unrealistic unless you paid a lump sum to start up your insurance , which i ' ve never heard of you have been paying for insurance coverage you ' ve already received . unless you can provide proof that you were insured by another insurance company during that same previous time period that you paid for after the fact , no , they do not owe you anything . they insured you for that month , you paid for it after . nothing you can do
   (ID: 20ee46767f4f96df6795d9b93f6c4c7be9a56261)

20. oh i miss what unpopular opinion was chocked full of this juice . though i seriously gotta side with you . some men and women simply are attracted to children . having those thoughts alone does no hurt expect , potentially to the thinker but it ' s only when actions are sought that justice is needed . for example i guarantee there have been multiple times you ' ve thought of killing someone . isn ' t that just as bad if not worse than rape ? so why isn ' t that condemned
