   (ID: 9bfbecc03ccfaabc74f8b279ee93f1fef4725469)

3. it ' s hard to tell i mean we already know to check for the puddles now we have to check all the seams on spider  man ' s outfit . what ' s next every wire on rhino ' s suit of armor ? every web spider  man shoots ? insomniac doesn ' t seem to care about quality control as i do .
   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

   (ID: 725e5a3de682f359cfb87481ec457a2f78867ef3)

8. i ' m digit  would love to cosplay . i ' ve seen some online images of costumes people have made  it looks so amazing  fun . something like elizabeth from bioshock infinite or elsa from frozen . but i ' m probably too old to start  would probably be called mutton dressed as lamb if i dressed as these younger women . i have no idea if cosplay existed when i was in my 20s in the early ' 90s when the internet was a noisy slow dial  up affair , but if it did i wish i had known about it . it looks so fun . especially steampunk . i ' d love to go steampunk . but at my age i ' d probably look ridiculous .

9. One of my favorite things is london shirts.
   (ID: 17d5718d86b2560f3a04d8427f0e5fb4b969bed3)

10. glad to hear that , it ' s a shame they fell out of fashion . nothing fancy really . just normal bras and panties , but i have to wear stockings to keep the corset anchored so it wouldn ' t start riding up . yep , i ' d love to get a custom made one . they ' re pretty darn expensive though , at least about digit and i ' d have to get them sent from the us as that ' s where all the good corset makers are . most of them have noticed by now , and the feedback has generally been very positive . they think i ' m mad for attempting something like this especially on a daily basis when most people can barely stand regular shapewear for a few hours but the benefits are very obvious .
   (ID: 2807a3ccd9923500b4054e9b094634bbd571e6ea)

11. oh my lord , what an idea why haven ' t i thought of this ? i have an old ds from digit and i learned to make custom themes , so i could do the same
   (ID: 8487a8406f04273c554e2e578c3a667648916790)

12. i typically find it easier to show them a picture if i want a new style . if i want a trim i just say something like " a digit fade on the sides and just the tips off the top "
   (ID: e7d4349520d7fd2b6b8d8e41558874e7ce55f7c3)

13. thank you for your answer ! yeah i see what you mean . i  ve never seen the sleeping one before and i thought were the same as the ryokan one because they looked so similar when i searched them on google image . the problem is , in tourist shop they only sell the matsuri one , usually with the big obi and shoes etc . but i  ll keep looking thank you !
   (ID: 272bbd1e0746915faf3405ae9c33485b5967ca9f)

14. thanks ! i will probably try it with a few different rums until i find one i like the most .
   (ID: 2e464b2732570f16afced14ab79d30fa92622627)

15. i don ' t know why they switched . most articles on the topic mention the same sequence of events , with that detail missing . 1800s  kids ' clothes are unisex . everyone wears white dresses until around the age of digit or digit . white because it ' s the easiest to clean at the time . 1910s  blue is mentioned for girls , pink for boys . 1940s  the public decides they want gender  differentiated clothing . manufacturers , for whatever reason , go against the social norms of the previous few decades .
   (ID: aac80ac9ebef70ab8fe6bc14a8fcccb472099b84)

16. One of my favorite things is menards.
