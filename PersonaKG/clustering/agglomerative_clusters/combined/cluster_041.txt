14. people tend to confuse tilt  shift effect with miniature effect . we ' re talking the latter here . i ' ll try to explain it shortly  when you are photographing a large  scale landscape see the unmodified picture in the reply to the first post , everything tends to be in focus you have large , often infinite depth of field . as you get closer and your subjects  smaller , depth of field becomes smaller i . e . less of the scene is in focus . if the same scene is composed with toys , i . e . if the balloons were , say , coin  sized , the photo would look like the processed one , but for optical reasons . if you were to achieve the same thing , but in an optical way , you would need a very , very large camera sensor comparable in size to the balloon and a very , very long in focal length lens which would be proportional to you shooting the scene with the toys . in  camera software or the one that ' s used on a computer can somewhat succesfuly fake this effect , which is often the case .
