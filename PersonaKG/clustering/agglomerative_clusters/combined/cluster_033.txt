1. i hate how people think that it ' s a woman ' s job to be the one who does housework . in a perfect relationship yes , i know there ' s no such thing both the man and woman do equal parts of the housework .
   (ID: 975493e3b4b2ad9cba1b98554159be45f8affdd3)

2. we had a player in my city who came from a different , larger city for work . back then the lgs was new and so were the players so he ' d shark trades and crush fnms and other events easily . anyways eventually i learnt how to play properly and became a better player than him , so he stopped coming the actual bad experience however was when i was to his old store back in the larger city  he knew the owner personally and that was where he went to sell off his robbed cards and stuff  he ' d given the town a reputation as a place where everyone can barely play and he gets to sweep the trades and tournaments without trying . me being one of the few people to stick with the game after he ' d ruined it so thoroughly , i guess he ' d really made up some stuff about me out of spite so i get in and as soon as i ' m asked where i ' m from it starts getting whispered around  the standout experience was me asking how much they wanted for their foil tamiyo ,  i wanted it as an anniversary gift for my girlfriend but depending on whether they used f2f or scg pricing it would ' ve been better to get her the expedition hallowed fountain  and the clerk just told me " more than ten bucks still want it ? " and walked away without ringing me in i didn ' t spend any money there , but i drove back up for an edh tournament and got second , and then again and got first . now they ' re nicer to me but having to earn respect from strangers after being the butt of rumours soured me on the community , i go to a different place

3. immediately owning up to your mistake and making a visible and concentrated effort to prevent repeating it in the future works wonders .
   (ID: f39e591889b6331bd255039773030c1b50c7e201)

4. seriously ? you could  ve kept your silence and be far more appreciated , but now you  ve said something that tarnishes this dude  s beginning stages of a passion . p . s . don  t be  that dude
   (ID: 61d850113b440da97216a14cfd8a5509352c72b2)

5. without having spoken to the guy you conjured up what you wanted him to be , that ' s a recipe for disaster . secondly , comparing yourself to your friend is a sure fire way to be disappointed .   x200b  its cliche , but there are plenty of dudes that love dark skin women . there are fellas that love every woman , just because he likes your friend doesn ' t mean he ' s incapable of liking you too . this whole colorism thing is something we dark skin cats go thru , just be you unapologetically so .   x200b  your friend , from the way you are describing it , seems to have some deep seethed issues with being black . getting back with her ex , then going on a crucible to figure out if the guy you ' re interested in is gonna waste your time is mental lol .   x200b  i don ' t think youre being paranoid .
   (ID: b5cc14fd703a97548093b4e06f7e3e92575b80b9)

6. how dare that motherfucker enjoy something different than the way you do ! you sure told him .
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

7. esh leaning on nta provided you used protection . anyway you can send him a message and tell him whatever you want if you think it  ll make you feel better but i doubt it  ll have any affect on his behaviour what so ever .
   (ID: 64cd7a2c07766ef2725fa67e6025759ae1f56c2b)

8. i  m pretty sure my neighbor is into some hardcore drugs as the cops have stopped by quite a few times . weirdest thing is seeing home move next door and being this completely normal dude to now being a crazy drug addict . i remember the first time i met him he was really nice and we talked about music for a while while i was cleaning my car . fast forward to a year or so later , i got home from work late and he was walking by and he tried to shake my hand and wouldn  t let it go as he told me that he was a nymphomaniac .
   (ID: 952775daf59c315371d07b780312217bf98c8464)

9. yeah , he knows there ' s no point in doing the therapy if he doesn ' t follow the protocols . i can ' t think past the ect right now . obviously , this is a huge strain on my marriage . i can ' t let him think about it either , because i need him to get there first .
   (ID: 54097549786e78808b0d9772bb36b401b5761588)

10. wow that ' s a hard story . what does your so say about it ? it ' s hard to make a decision . if you ' re able to forgive him and that it ' s the " true love " , maybe you can do it , manage his life with his child and have a family with you . but he cheated on you , whereas you wanted a family with him and so did he . so i can ' t see a lot of hope , you ' ll be maybe jealous of his ex wife because you wanted this child and your relation with your so can quickly become toxic . i think you would be happier with someone who deserves you and will be able to have a family with you and above all won ' t cheat on you after one year of relation .
   (ID: 862cb85d93fa9b931c3c64cf2fd17ef592d48c50)

11. with your husband ' s permission , you could start a blog and write about your experiences or just post here every monday and tell us about it . you could spend time researching ideas for next weekend . maybe learn to deep throat or other creative skills he might appreciate . shop for some sex toys . i like the blog idea , though .
   (ID: 0d77404b10744947bcd2c91d8c926021d4b8650f)

12. i mean you could just ask if he wants to hang out just the two of you , and if je suggests more friends to bring take it as a hint he doesn ' t like you like that .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

13. but you  re complaining about how mean it is and how hurt you are . why the fuck do you care ?
   (ID: d7ab0e5728c419d1e50c8ba827489e51566c046b)

14. how you get them is how you lose them . why would you think that he would be faithful to you ? i ' m pretty sure he ' s reassuring you the same way he reassured her .
   (ID: e762afbb043380ba48c73fe9d10d74d8daeb8b17)

15. so he is name  calling and spreading gossip ? that tells you a lot about the person he is . it doesn ' t say anything about you . just be honest about what happened .
   (ID: fd98a0804e382a144d76dd9fdb6ff8323a9d6b21)

16. depends on whether it ' s a good marriage or a bad one . a good marriage is like living with your best friend , but you also get to have sex with them all the time .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

17. sending you love , fuck him . you ' ll be ok .
   (ID: 1d327d2812dfee71bf8ef77d36ffd5eb70efd55b)

18. he ' s digit years older than you and you ' re gonna have a miserable life ahead of you if you stay . you gotta worry about yourself first . you do what you think you need to do .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

19. huh ? why would you want to lose your life span ? also , how awkward would it be if you weren  t his most loved one .
   (ID: dee55cb599fd271c24c829dd8a42067aea446ab7)

20. wow you are definitely overreacting and why are you essentially using your emotions to manipulate your boyfriend ? the sister said no , twice . save some face and accept that . you cannot force your way into a family trip . you  re not family . respect the sister  s decision . you  ve really not even been dating that long . is it bad that your boyfriend didn  t consider that maybe you  d be alone , yes . but you had so much prior notice about this trip . you could have arranged your own plans ! like why does your life revolve around your boyfriend anyways ? you could have easily made plans with your friends or take a solo trip somewhere , if your own family didn  t extend an invite to you . you just come off sounding really entitled to be honest .
