1. in the wise old words of grandpa simpson  i used to be with  it  , but then they changed what  it  was . now what i  m with isn  t  it  anymore and what  s  it  seems weird and scary . it  ll happen to you ! i always thought i would need this quote . apparently , it ' s at digit years of age now .

   (ID: 24d2489761902de9148fe06d43ec8d7e34c8e35b)

4. i ' m digit and feel some of your pain . i like some peoples answers of oh just feel better thats all you need . some days isn ' t that easy . i don ' t have a bad life by any means but struggle to motivate myself to do fun stuff or even daily chores .
   (ID: 37dcb77e38bb95527b0376694dc5852e5c3012eb)

5. hello , how do you mean you feel like your in the wrong place ? could you elaborate .
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

6. you will live for your extreme levels of depression . i ' m sorry man . hope you are doing better .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

7. oh it is several things . the first thing you do is completely cut off all of the energy vampires in your life . try to figure out if somebody is making you feel bad . maybe they aren ' t trying to . that being said , many people are subtly abusive and you might not know that what you are feeling is not you , it is somebody else ' s toxic emotions that they have projected on to you . learn about adaptogenic herbs and supplements and start an adaptogenic stack . loneliness sometimes is just stress , fatigue or a chemical imbalance . i recommend , n acetyl l tyrosine rhodiola rosea , ashwagandha  ksm  digit , tumeric  curcuminoid with pipeline , magnesium citrate , fish oil and vinpocitine . make sure you are listening to positive people , positive music , positive messages and are engaged in plenty of self affirmation . then you want to reach out to people . being lonely means that you have to project onto others what you wish to receive so you have to give the right people your time , love and attention . loneliness sometimes isn ' t helped by being around more people even though i recommend this but is more ameliorated by improving your relationship with yourself . maybe you need to be a better friend to yourself ? do you think you should read more ? maybe exercise  jog  lift more ? do you think you should listen to more music or get out more ? do you need to clean or decorate your apartment ? do an all the above approach and remember that you can always give yourself permission to feel loved and cared for without a material manifestation to validate it ! often people feel warmth , generosity , compassion and admiration first , and then the outside world reflects that feeling . try to exercise your mind with meditation and being to dim certain thoughts and emotions . if you can fake happiness , after a while it becomes a muscle that builds over time .
   (ID: a94c33f7a102c979d2b0d24245a9721d4136b14f)

8. you ' re not pathetic . i think you ' re just a bit introverted , and that ' s fine . i find friends at work , at school , and before i knew all these people i was alone like you . how do you fight this feeling ? you love yourself enough to just let it be . you become fearless , because you know you don ' t need anyone to be happy . you can ' t force yourself to become friends with people . it doesn ' t work like that .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

9. don ' t worry my friend . this game depression come and goes . i was like that for like a month . the only thing i wanted to do was watching netflix and youtube videos . i have a backlog of games i got during the holidays that i haven ' t even touched . just recently started playing darksiders . been enjoying it so far . try doing something different for a while .
   (ID: 4d25d96176282a43e7d25733ea90ce07a471eac2)

10. those stories are almost always bullshit from people who want to scare you or score drugs or keep other other people as miserable as they are . there  s a happy life that  s just waiting for you that just takes a little bit of effort and if you  re standing between that and death and you  d rather choose death because one requires a little trust and putting work into yourself than you  re a coward . i wouldn  t be wasting my thanksgiving trying to convince you it  s possible if i didn  t think you could do it . you just have to take that first step .
   (ID: ead4924f7abc0f9258d2b484a3f379aedee2cc5c)

11. i ' m not gonna say that you ' re ok , so many people have made the mistakes you have and to get out of it you have to work hard . then you will be happy about your life and not need anyone else to tell you your doing ok , because you ' ll know you are .
   (ID: cedcbee1b270d7b3c90109c069d452a800ba09a7)

12. i haven ' t been in your spot , but i ' ve been similarly low in different ways . i know what it ' s like to feel as if you have no way of ever being anything close to " normal " your low point becomes all you know , all you can imagine , and all you can accept . i assure you , though , there are always ways out . do you have any family or friends who can help you ? are there any mental health facilities near you that you could go to possibly inpatient ? it may not be significant , but i should note that foot fetishism is not your fault in any way . it ' s how you ' re wired . you just have a case of actual fetishism , not just a kink . i won ' t tell you to not be hard on yourself . i know it ' s not that simple  i ' ve been there . i want you to be aware that you ' ve made much more progress than you realize in even asking how you can change , though . the best advice i can give you as a nonprofessional , but as someone who has also been at " rock bottom " as you described yourself elsewhere , is to start small . if you try to tackle it all at once , you ' ll continue to be overwhelmed .
   (ID: 372e357e1e3acd2a4dea24aa56a5900a539a9e59)

13. i had a similar face with lsd , where i just wanted to trip at every occasion . because i never had a single bad experience , only beneficial ones . thsi phase ended after digit or digit months , my mind needed a break and i didn ' t want to trip even when there was a great opportunity . for me the craving for acid feelt different than to any other drug , it wasn ' t like wanting to recreationaly better my mood like with any other drug . it feelt more like having discovered something new , where you can ' t wait for your next time doing it . it feelt like when i got a new video game for christmas as a kid and after an hour , when my parents made me go to bed , i couldn ' t wait to explore it more the next day . but after some time this always stoped , only to be rediscovered years later . the same feeling was attached to lsd after my first spiritual experience . and the same way it got more and more unexciting until i stopped using for a year or so . and this wasn ' t hard to do , it just felt right to stop now . when the spirit of adventure came back i started tripping again . even if lsd helped me a lot to learn about myself like nothing else could even come close . thinking about my usage in honesty is only possible during times of abstinence . your post sounded similar to my concern at times of frequent use and your concerns are important and nothing you should be avoiding , especially when using strong psychedelics . i could understand my frequent lsd use after it ' s ending and also be ok with having those phases because i never feelt my frequent use was damaging . i would even say such phases are welcomed by myself , when they feel right again . do not rely on what i wrote . this surely isn ' t the only reason for somebody using lsd so often . if you think your desire exists because lsd lets you be happy when you feel depressed , confident when you are shy or just lets you be the person you want to be , but aren ' t capable of otherweise . thats how damaging and addictive behaviors start . lsd may not be addictive in the ways other drugs are , but it surely will make you dependent , if used to escape your sober self . i can ' t tell you what ' s best for you , just go with what feels right for you . just be sure to honestly think about your consumption . when you understand your behavior better , it comes easier to stop or continue . since lsd does not have a physically addictive side , the reason for an addiction arises from your mind . stopping or continuing depends on the reason why you are consuming in the first place . but if you are in doubt , its better to take a break . you probably wouldn ' t have asked here if there isn ' t something worrying you about your usage . i can only tell you that i personally say that frequent lsd use , is one of the least damaging drugs , if not pushed beyond what feels good . just take some time to really organize your thoughts , minds and goals . be honest , follow what feels right for you . lsd is exhausting for your mind , some time to think may offer you what you hadn ' t capacity and time to find out during the time of constant tripping .

14. there ' s more to life than what it is for you now . there ' s a whole fucking lot , little guy . you live , learn , experiment and feel a lot of things along the way , and you never even know what it ' ll bring you , which is the most fun part ! just like good ol ' retarded tom hanks once said
   (ID: de078b4353965122ac7bf05afe8d580d01d4a928)

15. i don ' t feel like my perception of reality is very off it is that i am way more critical of myself than i would be months ago and some weeks are worse than others to the point i don ' t want to get out of bed . i also don ' t feel like anything triggered it really it just sort of stuck it ' s head out of the blue , i don ' t really know how else to discribe it .
   (ID: 2abaf8413c23e36fd4e8a1e879a2875dea6dbf69)

16. was at that point digit years ago , no friends , wife left me for a woman , family digit miles away . i found this to be my new life , a reset . now i have remarried and have an incredable full life . grab life by the horns , get out of your comfort zone , do new things . you don ' t have to be alone .
   (ID: 02e4b90101e07338b4251209256c01652a022c5d)

17. i kind of missed this chaos . relatable . i ' ve been doing really well for a few months and i find myself missing my " old " self . life was more interesting . anyway , for your question , i have to annoy myself into taking my meds . i set at least digit reminders  alarms on my phone telling me to take them , and usually after the first digit alarms i get annoyed and  or guilt tripped into taking my meds . when i ' m really bad and that doesn ' t work , i give my bottles to someone else , and then they have bring me my meds on time and watch me take them .
   (ID: f0d30d31e879077978622dde48ddd9e0f254b33d)

18. work on self love , bud . because if it does turn south , you ' ll at least have your own back .
   (ID: f35d74d4d36905b144a4851bae7ac6c2014ebdbd)

19. don ' t say that . the fact that you are afraid to lose your creativity is well enough a reason to continue this fight . you have to keep at it because you deserve to be happy and have every right to enjoy life . waking up every day is you winning this fight . seeking help is winning this fight . dont be afraid to quit something or start something , be it medication or not . if something doesn ' t suit you or brings you to a negative state of mind , change it , talk to someone about it , or eliminate it completely . keep up the fight .
   (ID: 51e06ea43809bd7f43c9c3b13a19193236a72570)

20. it sound that those people in your life are holding you back and that isn  t good for mental health . i  m not saying you should get rid of them but certainly make them aware that your life is more than chores or work and everyone needs a hobby and shouldn  t have to hide it .
