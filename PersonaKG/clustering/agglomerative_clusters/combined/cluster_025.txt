1. okay , that sucks , but what about the thousands of items we do get undamaged ? i grouse about usps sometimes , but , overall , i think they  re amazing . if you got digit delicious meals for every bad one , would you call for the cook to be fired ?
   (ID: 7a74975099c43e606800d8a9205ec41703ec2a89)

3. be aware that if you ' re caught and you probably will be , no matter which way you go about it , the consequences may be a bit more severe than them just saying " no , you can ' t do that " . you may well be ejected from the park , barred for life , or possibly have security involved . the only way for you to do it and feign ignorance and possibly get away with it and i am not condoning this at all would be to try going through hogwarts express or the main entrance and , if caught and chances are you will be , saying that you thought the parks were the same . but , if you try this , you ' re a bit of an idiot , and even more of a complete git .
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

   (ID: 90492fed4b9d785ee43d655875f81a82e68a1263)

   (ID: 0c68cfdaec11ee0673f6c5aec23193d412bf30ba)

8. legally , yes , you would have to be paid for the hours that you worked , regardless of when you step down . typically though i mean , i don ' t know what kind of job you have you give your employer two weeks ' notice before you plan on taking your last day .

10. very late to this but one thing i have realised is , don ' t tell anybody your true end date for your sentence . tell them one year later . why set yourself up for harassment and being targeted by fellow inmates who are jealous of you ?
   (ID: 359f9ab2b3224a06fb2eeef0a72bf286f2fe9fa5)

   (ID: 43582d67310e995ea85c152bb256b0596144bf82)

13. i took this question as what policy the manager should implement for themselves . i have noticed that management only does what the higher ups tell them . there is no leadership . what is lacking in most places are leadership . i ' m not in a good headspace on this topic bc of my current employer lacks leadership especially at the lower levels . our turn over rate is atrocious . i always think of the old army doctrine of " people first , mission always " if you can understand what that requires , then you are on the path to good leadership .

14. it may have been other than honorable . in complete honesty i don  t know much about how it works , it  s just what we were always told . i did look it up and it sounds like he would  ve gotten other than honorable . he went awol . just dipped out because he didn  t feel like doing it anymore . i do know he definitely did not get an honorable discharge , anyway hahahaha

   (ID: cfd691d6aeaf46cc644b0e21187d10dfc62b0bc8)

19. in all fairness , sometimes it works out for people to hire someone to assemble it , especially if they ' ve got multiple complicated pieces . it might take an inexperienced person with no tools a day or two of frustration and sore hands to finish , when they ' d rather take only half a day off work , and spend a day ' s wages paying someone else to put it together in a few hours . my dad assembles furniture for a living , he charges  digit   hr when it ' s just him digit  digit   hr if he takes one of his kids to help , though a lot of that is to cover expenses and taxes for running his own business . so i ' m glad there are lazy people .
   (ID: 32963b268f862205bfe0776470d7730e54b581ec)

20. former hotel manager here . this for sure ! managers are held under such high scrutiny in this industry and can be seen as relatively disposable . a positive review for a manager that had to give a service recovery could go a long way for them . also , as a gold member , the hhonors desk is your best friend . they will often go to bat for you should you have issues in the future .
