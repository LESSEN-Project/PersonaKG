1. i question the kind of women you classify as beautiful
   (ID: 5fa74a7d6a70c6f2f8a149864f494ac72eefd3e4)

2. doesn ' t matter . that ' s too damn long , dude . that ' s a problem . life is about suffering and survival . get over it or they ' re weak ! i ' ve also been guilty of such situations . sometimes it hurts a little to think about certain loves of my past . you gotta punch through those feelings . be with friends and do the things i like to do . i don ' t date because i want that feeling back , i date because i enjoy the company of that person .
   (ID: c22fbcc3fbb3286d348387d73888b66c1c9e09ba)

3. i am sorry if thats completely wrong what i am gonna say , because i don ' t have experience . but wouldn ' t it be possible to stretch your skin slowly before engaging in penetrativ sex . maybe take some extra 10min before , where you stretch and work the skin back slowly with some lubricant . sure this may not be the most sexy thing to do in the middle of a heated moment with you so , but a serious partner should be supportive when it just during the waiting period . if this doesn ' t work , you can also find sexual pleasures without engaging in something like penetrativ sex , where a retracting foreskin is required . a oily handjob over the skin could probably make me come even without having direct contact to the penis glans . and if you are into butt stuff , this could be the time to explore some new ideas .
   (ID: e5a44ccd2ce03ba23fc6a9fd527ffc5440b8088c)

4. u seem to forget  don ' t know that we guys are mostly straight foreword . that phrase ' i ' m not looking for anything now ' we register it on face value . e . g . okay so not right now but if i play my cards right i can get a chance later . i know that you can ' t just go and say i ' m not sexually attracted to you , but in an ideal world you should so can ' t help you there . i think that ' s a problem that most girl face so your attractiveness isn ' t a game changer . that ' s why male  female ' friendships ' are almost always going to fail .
   (ID: e9d9b9400a09031a7e1021173867d784ebb9cf94)

5. they could just be really busy . that is a possibility , i hardly speak to my best mate anymore , but he works real fucking hard now so i understand we can ' t hang out everyday anymore
   (ID: 84b2c69cbe8c44b78569e5e8b9af935f703ee480)

6. well again , not to take away from your problems , but everyone has them . even those that seem to have all their shit together are dealing with something . hang in there my friend .
   (ID: 7c5209c3b827e0de0cd436466f80ce09b615606b)

7. similar ! i don  t care if my friends go without me but i do care when they insult me . i don  t really care who else insults me whether it be a stranger or family , but if my friends insult me i will think about it for at least two decades and become extremely insecure as a result of it .
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

8. eat a snickers , you aren  t yourself when your boyfriend causes you of making him lose his video game .
   (ID: 9ec97fcc6f16d54d7e24ba1cdb5ebe5785854536)

9. what ' s attractive ? humans are just generally funny  looking , don ' t worry about it .
   (ID: 62ca7edc7c8626b2c19aff26f29414c7649772cd)

10. pray it will work if you are believer , if not . well pray anyway
   (ID: dd50b301fbfd713e92cffecd0a18fa135e6d75d3)

11. you ' re pretty self  congratulatory about your relationship , but the examples you give further down are far different than the struggles some people have in their relationships . failed exam ? not getting promoted ? that ' s life . if you have to pat yourself on the back for staying with someone through that then perhaps you have a different and privileged lens . my read on this thread is that their partner has persistent deep rooted issues that aren ' t improving despite ops best efforts and support . it can take the relationship beyond saving , and it ' s important to recognize that and take care of yourself   if all other options have failed . so revolution outcast ,  digit for the advice from half  elfbard .
   (ID: b61e1d4de0e5d22ad937104e46a2657b01e7cca9)

12. i guess so . even though they gave me ptsd and were partly at fault for my depression , they might be goin through the exact same thing with guilt .
   (ID: e87275c4c3cfea671e40cbeff9a12d5fc1372f97)

13. I'm interested in personality.
   (ID: 6ea82786a74ccdc85dc1fddd809a575aa4e4efcf)

14. possibly it  s that then , i didn  t think i had particularly strong features , just a  standard  face if such a thing exists . quite possibly my personality has something to do with it as i  ve always been mature for my age .
   (ID: c391065478603a686531cbdd50568136a5e14508)

15. i find people who have a drinking problem love to judge those who don ' t . i was told once that i ' m only fun when i drink by someone i mostly saw through the bottom of a wine glass , so i stopped drinking and hanging around that person . don ' t allow anyone to cross your boundaries , it ' s not worth it even a little . best of luck !
   (ID: 8b7590cb8502d6abd38b320b842aa7642186b6d8)

16. ive reached point where material items dont really do much for me anymore . im just looking for a relationship at the moment , and to plan out my life so i dont end up working until im dead .
   (ID: ae9e10cc82b9b20c52f819c70c83f657724f9f44)

17. i totally agree . that ' s one of my favorite things about my boyfriend , we both know our jobs and aspirations come first , which is why long  distance has worked for us .
   (ID: 32963b268f862205bfe0776470d7730e54b581ec)

18. that  s true . it  s more knowing that there was a time this person played a vital part in your life and now they  re barely more than a fleeting thought every once in a while . it  s so scary how things change
   (ID: d9ec7752117a31823171b7cfc56b1cf267be53df)

19. i never ever discussed or explained how i felt all these years , and i know people wouldn  t care even if i did so thats my approach , but in your case you have digit options , either pretened nothing happened and and keep those friends or ditch them and be better for yourself
   (ID: c63be1429c6442ee9219ae1573b45fc7a40d22f2)

20. im sorry they are making you feel this way man i hear you . i can relate and it fucking sucks when your own family treats you like this . how old are you ? maybe save up and move out as quickly as you can . its not permanent , youll get through it !
