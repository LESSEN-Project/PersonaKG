1. it  s dangerous and annoying . i don  t even get high anymore and it still makes me paranoid !
   (ID: addb5c6e93320b8955b216917ee93bd0b85f0646)

2. i mean it was the first time i watched it i was chilling in bed and all i hear wen i click on my mates stream is  in the name of the holy spirit   scared the balls off me
   (ID: b7515713c74346e74e6961342ed7324a056c09e6)

3. the way i look at it i thought that was a better idea is doing that would have served digit purposes .  shown shaw which the movie did already that her beliefs were based on a misunderstanding of what actually happened .  thereby showing how hard people to grasp on to an idea that is so completely false . i think it would have played a more centralistic role on attacking christianity ' s " soul . i think this is inevitably why it wasn ' t done in the film . edit wanted to fact check before adding that ridley scott is an atheist i don ' t think the way he portrays religion in his films are meant to be taken as correct somehow .
   (ID: ef2d2779d22f02bc07c4cd818cf0cb36422fbdd7)

4. i absolutely agree with all your points . especially about letting the kids wander away . but i love the show for the zombies . need more zombies ! on the flip side , i do believe that the characters really are a pathetic group that don ' t think rationally . i suppose after their world is turned upside down with so much death and destruction , they don ' t think , plan , and " survive " as well as we do in the comfort of our living room chairs . but the drawback to that as a drama series is that i lose sympathy for them , and start not caring what happens to them . in fact , i start waiting for them to get picked off by the zombies and start cheering for the undead . one thing i noticed was there were a lot more dead people this time , and they were quite rotted away  dried husks . i understand people rotting  bloating , but would they be so dried out ? atlanta is not exactly a dry desert environment . has the zombie invasion been going on for that long ? as for the radiator hose , i had an old chevy vega that broke a hose on a cross country trip . i fixed it with hose tape but it would only last digit miles before it broke again . so yeah , once your hose is shot , it ' ll keep disintegrating until you can replace it . but what bothers me , there are so many abandoned vehicles on the road , couldn ' t they switch to something better than an rv ?
   (ID: e8daa61bfd9bf81549666ebd0bdf393156b492de)

5. all the star wars
   (ID: 2e2a44cdfc726423ec202a2fe420543af441d1ad)

6. how is there a game called prison architect ? i would have thought that something like that would cause some controversy .
   (ID: 26eaf1fafb916f4238e66dfba6deb9da540be2f6)

7. marvel and star wars . i like both but it ' s gotten to that point , where it now just annoys me .
   (ID: 95f6209d0c49920f0309625c4cec2ea88e4ae469)

8. everyone is talking about avengers end game and i havent seen any of the avengers movies
   (ID: e807b18e05d35f02282740d90e8c63546558b267)

9. but those digit characters are unlikable and very annoying . i think it ' s gonna be jay . the guy is pretty old and they might end it with him on his deathbed . he ' ll say a few words to each of the family members , everyone cries , fade to black .
   (ID: 5366d3e890f8a540d03733631ae8f32ef2335c31)

10. for me it depends on what else it would be , for example lord of the rings sounds interesting .
   (ID: 2a4bb889e40b61bb1755181c2b46750d3a082604)

11. i really don ' t know why people look so much into stories and anime . do you really care ?
   (ID: 7516d7366722f6b725b75d67b20b486be035a9c5)

12. yeah there  s hidden stars in the blockbuster photos and you need to work it out and if you go to said location then it  s there .
   (ID: b7515713c74346e74e6961342ed7324a056c09e6)

13. i accidently slipped that alan was secretly still alive . at least they dont know that he ' s now endebted to an insane deity that wont let him stay dead
   (ID: 41ecb08cd807b953da29a82cba9ddfcf32745fc3)

14. i think everybody should see it one time . one of those movies you wouldn ' t be able to guess the ending in a million years .
   (ID: 7bbefe3c73b49467552610b8dad9354ce8c09cde)

15. what do you mean you ' ve never seen blade runner ? oh , maybe i was a little too wild in the 70s back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
   (ID: f72a72c8ffe94061edd962dd3f8293ca75595021)

16. i read what you put at the beginning but if you believe they should ' ve been in the top digit , you could ' ve included them anyway . i just don ' t think there should ' ve been an honorable mention list for intros that are worthy of being in the actual list .
   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

17. airplane . i understand that it was one of the first of its kind but i don ' t really care for it . my friend had me watch it because he said it is his favorite comedy of all time but i give it a digit  digit .
   (ID: 388a9b7cd52305ad65297c63f4c50272c2661e4c)

18. i haven  t watched in some time now , but there was a time , where i used to watch every single episode . why ? you ask . for the same reason i tell idiots who claim it  s fake . we all know it  s scripted , but the answer is in its description  sports entertainment  it  s fine if you aren  t entertained by it , but why ruin it for the rest of us that are entertained by it ?
   (ID: 89fd53ef642d85d9a24d63f88469480646354104)

19. my big fat greek wedding digit , we laughed all threw it . the critics sure didn ' t .
   (ID: 74cc8b596c27cbe385709690baaf3b68f39b3915)

20. i hate streaming movies , the quality no matter how good your internet is almost always is worse than the physical copy . another reason i don  t use it is because there have been times at my friends house that we want to watch a movie but he only streams so if his internet is out and it happens pretty often , he  s pretty cheap we can  t watch anything .
