1. just wanted to reassure myself . thank you !
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

2. first of all , a hug to you . glad you got some good insurance . when i was first diagnosed they had me in steroids for quite some time , about digit years . i hated it . i gained so much weight and am only now being able to finally lose it again . i ' m on entiviyo now , which is a biologic . i tried remicaid and himura , had an allergic reaction to himura , and remicaid didn ' t work . like a previous poster said , discuss treatment with your doc . odds are he ' s gonna prescribe some immunosuppressive medicine like aziathioprine , also known as imuran . you ' re going to have to get pretty regular blood work done to monitor your liver while you ' re on imuran . and asacol or lialda may he prescribed too . just make sure to eat as well as you can , talk to your doctor about your treatments , don ' t be afraid to ask questions , and maybe join a support group for you and your husband .
   (ID: 2d26439362b22d8737b6d2a810c70fc3b9a3ddaa)

3. i know i ' m not reinventing the wheel or anything , but it helps to hear from someone who has gone through the same thing . thank you for the encouragement .
   (ID: 063122b93a40a719244d27587193e154f2fed59d)

4. mine are trash now . i ' d have to pay a ton for braces just to get them aligned properly . since teeth are finite i feel like since no matter how well i take care of them now they ' ll never be back in perfect shape , so i tend to not care as much . think how if the doctor told you your preferred arm will never have as good strength  motion as before your accident it ' s a terrible place to be .
   (ID: 7008f149db59fea91167255eafa8bc84beab0f01)

5. yes ! i loved you in " this is the end !
   (ID: 81230f8a6d5b3e00bae3b805b33ed6427ca86367)

6. no judgement here . i just posted my experience with an adverse med reaction and basically had the same line of thinking you ' re describing . it ' s unsettling has hell knowing your brain can actually think of things that you normally never would . best of luck moving forward !
   (ID: 2cfcabf07be1420284c0b650fae1643abc6e2bc4)

7. you and your compatriots are frequently the unsung hero of emergency services saving lives . kudos to you .
   (ID: 85bffe0bb9cbc6b9878fa42cd379cd2d4c7a27e1)

8. yup that  s always bad . could you read a magazine during so it won  t feel as awkward ? take someone who likes to talk with you so you don  t have to talk perhaps ? but as bad as that is a dentist that  s constantly asking you questions while you have digit things in your mouth is worst .

12. hey boys ! i ' ve been so hyped for something like this since trench came out , because i ' ve been a big fan since vessel era . heres my questions , feel free answer any of them . for the both of you  what , to you , is the most meaningful song you ' ve written , the song that you feel like expressed the most emotion of anything you ' ve created . why jason statham ? anything specific or just a simple joke that you fit into a song ? what is , in your opinion , the best and worse songs you ' ve ever written . will no phun intended ever be commercially sold ? i would kill to have that on a cd when do you plan to stop leaking songs tyler ?

13. it will look a bit daunting at first , start from the start of the tutorials , it will have you make a simple thing first . this is good as it teaches you the basics of what you need . whenever it feels like it is starting to swamp you a bit , stop , do something else for a couple of hours , do something physical . let your brain rest and then come back to it . it will be tempting to just try and power through it all right now , but you will struggle to even remember the first step if you do that . most importantly keep the scope of your project narrow . finish the first idea , see how it works , and get another perspective on it . ask someone that won ' t baby you to review it , and listen to what they have to say . then come back and see if you can improve the thing . small iterations with a review between them help you grow and learn .

14. here ' s another sv650 fan jumping in . bought my first sv650s after digit years of riding . best bike i ever owned in the " what a hoot to ride " category . i ' ve since had two more and an sv1000 which , while far more capable in most respects , just doesn ' t have the same just plain fun to ride character .
   (ID: 49c1f9b73ecf635bdf7d4c4715d79caa4c296579)

17. if you can afford it , a sleep number bed can help . i spent 25yrs fighting to sleep every night . i was using the traditional bed with a box spring and a mattress . we bought a sleep number bed . i now sleep very well . the 1st night we had the bed , i slept clean through the night and didn ' t wake up until nearly 9am saturday . it was light outside ! i nearly panicked . asked my wife , " holy shit ! what time is it ? how long have i been out ! "
