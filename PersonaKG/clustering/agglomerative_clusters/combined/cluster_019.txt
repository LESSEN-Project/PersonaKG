1. it ' s kind of difficult to judge , because some people are not comfortable expressing emotions verbally . but if you guys were having the talk , and you directly confronted him , and his response was that he " doesn ' t know how he feels , " then my bet would be that he is not in love , and just having a good time . if you ' re ok with that , then there ' s no problem . but if you ' re looking for a future and marriage etc , you very well might be wasting your time . another talk might be in order . figure out what it is exactly that you expect from the relationship . what your goals are , where you want to end up . in the end , if you want two different things , it might be a good idea to part ways before you get any more attached . best of luck op .

6. i legit saw the news and then i watched his last apology video . i cried . it has just been an extremely rough period for etika and he just couldn ' t pull through . it was not his fault . it was no one ' s fault . he just said a lot of things that backfired on him and then refused to get help . he was aware of his own situation but he just couldn ' t make it . he was a really cool dude overall who was always enthusiastic and funny . it ' s just sad to see him go away . rest in piece desmond amofah . we ' ll prove you wrong and never forget you .

10. i think what he ' s getting at is the idea that if someone is mentally unhinged example , a psychopath they don ' t really have control over what they do . the brain is the control center of everything we do . if its fucked up , then the person is basically screwed .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

11. coincidentally just finished my latest rewatch last night before bed and this post made me chuckle . creed ' s appearances in the last few episodes , and the grass roots story , is pretty funny . i like to think that creed , out of all of the characters that use their real names , is most like himself in real life .

19. " yea , i already have three bikes , but none of them do what this bike does , so i ' m gonna get this one too . " " but that ' s so many bikes " " sure but would you ever take a ferrari off  roading ? how about trying to race someone while driving a cargo van ? would you take all of your laundry and groceries on a bitch  bike motorcycle ? " i still think that ' s too many bikes " " i still think you ' re an idiot "
   (ID: b073b7138186ccb7fa807af1158cb23d6b7c113f)

20. one of the things my mother was best at was letting me be who i wanted , whether it meant having dreads for a while or dressing like jeffrey lebowski or listening to " that damn loud music " . he will do things that will make you think you have failed as a parent , but as long as he isn ' t harming anyone himself included and his grades don ' t take a huge dip , then he ' s just finding his way . also , be available . despite him acting like he has it all figured out , you know he doesn ' t . no amount of testosterone will make being a teenager any less scary .
