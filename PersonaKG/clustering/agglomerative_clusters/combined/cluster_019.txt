1. i would say screw it all and just tell my parents i ' m an atheist you can ' t put me through this . i don ' t care if they disown me or whatever . you have every right to speak your mind about who you really are . they have a problem with it ? then thats there issue .
   (ID: 7f9bca54da846f9c31cf145eaa5ec30d6531f5b6)

2. don  t blame yourself for being cheated on . no one deserves to be cheated on . it  s her being fucking shitty and don  t let anyone including yourself tell you otherwise
   (ID: eaa6b59bc56737180569c29d1db10b0dbbe8c265)

3. nah . i don  t think it  s really that big of a deal for her to go back and grab a couple of things while you are ringing up groceries as long as you  re not already done scanning and other people including you aren  t having to wait several minutes on her . on the other hand , i don  t think you were necessarily in the wrong . i mean , i understand your reasoning . if it is something that bothers you , you have the right to voice that . it  s probably something to bring up in the car on the way home or at home and not at the store , however .
   (ID: 2ace824638caac4e780f8ff3214dd1e7d868640e)

4. i hate to ask , but i feel i have too . at what point in your moms illness did you realize the fight was over ? or did you never come to that point ? i ask because i ' m dealing with some stuff and would really like to know . when do i stop " pretending " and start preparing for the inevitable . i ' m at a loss .
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

5. go and be supportive . say nothing that would be upsetting to them . that ' s what friends do . a funeral is not the time or place for you to express your views . it ' s not about you in the least .
   (ID: ff1587b69bf26c7b8e4def31e1d9036863ae4be3)

6. if things change that quick there is a hidden reason for it . maybe something like a better option if she was seeing someone else around you and you were a close second . maybe an ex contacted her again . maybe there was an aspect in your later talks that she couldn ' t get past . either way i think it ' s a lack of communication on her side as to what the reasoning for the drastic shift was . luckily you were early into it and minimal damage is done . one thing i ' ve always told myself and kind of my own line " expectation only leads to disappointment . " remember that , if it ' s expected and happens , it ' s nothing special . if it doesn ' t happen then it ' s only negative emotions .
   (ID: 15909870ffa903ea3b3962d8d81fd1701dd68aea)

7. i hope you find the love you deserve . you ' re definitely more aware of the fact that fast moving relationships , are enticing at first but maybe not the most rewarding . here ' s to the opportunity for a better chance next time . everything happens for a reason
   (ID: e81ca1234a368c583e7534e96af055654150cdb9)

8. bitches who say they got no emotions are the biggest pussies
   (ID: afdf67bb8f008481f179013844deeffa5b1b9a03)

9. compromise . you need to find a way for both of you to get a little of what you want . often time teenagers are completely oblivious to what they really need as support and same goes for parents not knowing where an appropriate line should be drawn usually out of fear or anxiety for their child  s well being you may see improvement if you take on more responsibility around the home or in the community  but that  s only a vague suggestion because i have no idea about your specific circumstances .

10. fuck no don ' t let her be one of your bridesmaid ' s i ' d tell rebecca exactly how you feel and why you ' re not letting her be one of your bridesmaid ' s and leave it at that this is your day , don ' t let anyone ruin it for you in any way
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

11. when i told my former boss that i was pregnant , she said that news would really upset the other girl in the office who had been having trouble conceiving . no congratulations to me or anything . i later miscarried and still no  i  m sorry  from the boss .
   (ID: c0c5a7c74c41387a99afab68d3e9fe0bfab4b8b9)

12. my second year of college a girl named alice fake name took my water bottle . sounds weird but stick with me on this . it was sitting next to me and i left it at my desk while i went to bathroom halfway through class . after i came back it was sitting a little closer to alice than it was to me but i didn ' t notice too much . class ends , everyone leaves , and a few of us start talking about weekend plans . and alice is holding the bottle . i thought " oh i forgot that and she ' s kindly returning it to me . sweet " nope . suddenly she takes a massive gulp out of the bottle . a bottle that i got for free from the lunch room . filled with water that was from the free drinking fountain digit feet outside the classroom . my friend greg fake name is the next one to notice and asks " isn ' t that jen ' s water " alice responds " oh , i thought somebody had left it from the last class . oops " cue another large gulp . greg is instantly disgusted and very confused . he rightly starts asking wtf ? alice tries to defend herself with " it ' s no big deal " and " finders keepers " and the perfectly reasonable " yolo . keep in mind , alice is a sophomore college student who has lived a completely normal american life as far as i know of . five minutes into this discussion , alice gets angry enough to leave in the middle of greg ' s sentence about personal space . no apology . no hint that she understand why it ' s wrong . next day she acted like nothing had ever happened . tl  dr girl in my college doesn ' t understand that stealing free water from other students for no reason is kind of weird .

13. i can ' t tell you how long it will last , but i can tell you that most likely you will not get burned like that again because you won ' t love unconditionally like that again . at least i didn ' t . it is actually kind of refreshing to know that i am now the one that is emotionally in control of my relationships now .
   (ID: 90492fed4b9d785ee43d655875f81a82e68a1263)

14. speak for yourself , zombie . i don ' t see how what you ' re doing is any better than what this chick is doing . in fact , your vanity in judging and thinking yourself superior is one of thr worst sins out there , if i ' m not mistaken .
   (ID: eeef74f05127fafe9b00ca3ad85ff51c0eb20fff)

15. " listen here , do you know who i am ? give me what i want or i ' ll make sure you ' re not back in this school next year " is a pretty common thing for normal parents as it is . i could only imagine it ' s worse with some celebrity parents . though that is only conjecture .

16. " when you find someone you really like as a person , tell them that you hope it grows into a closer relationship . if they don ' t feel that way . all is not lost , platonic female friends are a good ally when you ' re in the dating scene . " i actually don ' t have very nice experience with this thing . once i confessed to a girl that i want a close relationship with her . she said she didn ' t want it . i then decided to continue platonic friendship with her . i was now looking after other girls . one of whom was showing some interests in me through her body language . i was now interacting with this new girl on regular basis . she was sending positive indicators to me . my platonic friend asked me about my interests in that girl . i told her that yes i ' m interested in this new girl . i was also thinking about getting some female perspective  thought my platonic friend would be good wing  girl . i confessed my feelings to new girl . she accepted . i was a happy dude . but my winggirl started telling me that my new girlfriend is not the ideal girl  that in her words " she sleeps around " . i said that i ' ll be careful . i was on a trip to family for a week . when i came back , my new gf was ignoring me . i felt something is wrong . i just didn ' t know what . i then went straight to her  asked her what is wrong ? she didn ' t answer me . i asked again . this time she said that she didn ' t know i was sleeping with my winggirl . i asked her about who is telling her such things . she said the name of my wing  girl . i was shocked to hear that . i don ' t know why she did it . if she didn ' t want a relationship with me , why was she ruining my relationships with others . i know i shouldn ' t use this blanket thing to stereotype everyone . but now i feel its far better to get rejected  move  on than choosing to remain friends .
   (ID: 5ec957438fa111872baaa0871df8459459cc2519)

17. this is tough . it changes . when i met my wife it was exciting . not like a roller coaster more like consistently looking forward to the next time we interacted . what would happen next , talking about the future and of course the sexual appeal . butterflies . i knew we would be married one day even though we were in our late teens . i just knew . i didn ' t have " what if " thoughts to dissuade me . it ' s been nearly digit years now married digit . it ' s not excitement now it ' s deep deep caring . what would she think , how does she feel , how can i make it better . how can i ease a burden . she is my best friend . that old question about if you could go back and do it over knowing what you know now always stumps me . could i make different choices and still end up in this relationship ? because if i couldn ' t i wouldn ' t . sorry for the novel .

18. nah without knowing the details of the argument but generally if you want your aunt there , you should invite her . not inviting her will be mean and make it seem to her that you are taking everyone else ' s side . i wouldnt reccomend appeasment as your method of life , id reccomend talking to everyone involved and everyone that feels bad and talk with them about this whole situation and whether or not they can be adults and get over it for a day . i think if you like your aunt , would want to spend the birthday with her , the argument wasn ' t her fault and you proceed to not invite her you would be the asshole without a doubt . otherwise try talking to everyone involved
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

19. tell her that her dog knows how to use it ' s tongue better than she does
   (ID: 198c7cf8170708799eec80da464639ba2be896b4)

20. ahhhhh . that  s not okay . i mean i get that there are stay at home moms and all the power to them , but to rely on someone to keep you fed and clothed and then treat them like shit . i am a stay at home mom . who works a full time job out of our home as well as a part time job for a family member  s business . i might not have lunch packed for him every day , but he has food to eat and a decently clean house and love and respect  which i also have . it  s kinda sad for your ex wife tho  she hasn  t been able to let go and enjoy her life because she  s too busy being a shit .
