   (ID: 23436d4a3b029dec718d52bd8f69b7b3bb78dd25)

8. this post is too long , but i know exactly how you feel . i grew up in a similar situation , but i had digit older sisters ranging digit  digit years older than me . first you ' re an idiot for letting your mom drive drunk . you should have at least worried about the potential harm towards others . i think my parents weren ' t nice to me as a kid because they wanted to prepare me for the real world and ive come to appreciate it . life is going to be much harder on you if your a male , so you should be able to handle it . also wanting to be a musician i tought myself how to do everything and knowing that my parents wouldn ' t pay for my school no matter what i majored in , i spent digit years getting an ok paying job first . i know you don ' t want to hear about me though . my advice is digit  psychiatrists are witch doctors , dont waste your time of money . digit  distance yourself as much as you can from your family and live your own life .
   (ID: cbed067932829315de162cb512843a4f6b1083b7)

9. rip but that  s okay , my advice is have a look into some business . not school business but just start making something and selling it . i am now digit and when i was digit i managed to make myself  digit within a year making and selling protein balls . i  ve only stopped since cause i paralysed myself and been busy and exhausted to do it .

11. so i don ' t have personal experience with this yet , but i have wanted to change my name for about digit years now . i ' m about to finish college and might be moving away soon , so now seems like a pretty good time to go through with it . anyway , to answer your questions  1a as far as i can tell , most places that require a formal change e . g . your job , bank accounts , ect . are able to easily change people ' s names in their system probably because of people changing their name when they get married so that should be fairly straightforward . some places  like banks  may require proof that the name change is legal , but just show them a copy of the deed poll . please note  i live in the uk  the rules might be different where you live . 1b i ' ve found it really helpful to talk to a friend about changing my name . i told a couple of friends , but we ' ve only spoken about it on skype , never face  to  face , but recently i ' ve been talking to one of my friends about it in real life , not online , and it ' s so affirming , if that makes sense . before , i felt like it was all in my head , but having someone to talk to about it and again i emphasise a face  to  face discussion makes it feel not  weird . she ' s even offered suggestions for me . digit as far as explaining it to people goes , i haven ' t really had to fully explain my reasons to anyone . none of my friends really asked why , or if they did , they were satisfied with the ' i just hate my name and i am able to change it , so why shouldn ' t i ? ' explanation . i plan on having different ' levels ' of explanation , depending on who asks . so the first level would be ' because i want to ' which would be for acquaintances and people i don ' t know very well . then ' growing up , i really didn ' t like my name . it caused me a lot of grief , and i decided to move away from that , ' for the next level , for people i know better , and then for people i know really well and trust , the last level would be the full story , which is quite long and this message is long enough as it is but i ' m happy to share if you ' re interested . digit in the dating world , if you ' ve never met them before , just introduce yourself with your new name . they won ' t know that you were ever called anything else . you can tell them about your name change in time , but there ' s no need to do it right away . digit i mean , there ' s no limit on the number of times you can change your name that i know of anyway but if you change it too often , i think people will stop taking it seriously , or just get mixed up with which name you have at any given time . once you have a good idea of the name you want to use , try introducing yourself with it online . if your username doesn ' t have any actual names in it like mine here then you can introduce yourself with a different name to each person if you want , and just see if one feels right . when you ' re comfortable with that , try using it as a username . i ' d recommend getting people to call you the new name socially before you legally change it , so you can get used to it , and it won ' t be too much of a hassle if you change your mind . lastly , i would like to add that you ' re not a fraud . it feels weird at first and lots of people who change their name feel as if they ' re lying when they use their new name . you ' re not . you ' re used to being called one thing and now you ' re answering to something different , and that takes time to get used to . don ' t let anyone make you feel bad about it .

14. janet jackson . nothing .

15. you really not comparing yourself to another when someone in your class is smarter and you tell yourself you are stupid . you are only comparing your brain to that person ' s brain . there ' s so much more to you than that one part of yourself . if you find yourself comparing just one part of yourself to another and getting down on yourself , you need to compare the whole person or at least more than digit characteristic . for example , that person is smart . but they don ' t have the same hobby that i have had for years which i have gotten so many compliments about .

16. my future . i ' m in college and unemployed , and i worry about the years to come . will i get married ? will i get the job i ' ve always dreamed of ? will i make a decent living and afford a nice house with a gated entrance ? or , will it all be swept away if i fucked up or i died ? so many questions and so many things to worry about . its fucking depressing .

18. it  s about the stories we tell ourselves . the narratives we build in our heads . let me give you a few examples . if i bought into this dumb idea that you have your late teenage years and early 20s to build your future vs . i have my whole life to do it , then i have a huge problem once i  m not in my early 20s any more , and discovered that the career i picked in my late teenage years because all those well  meaning adults told me how f  cking important it was to pick my future career at that age is not a good choice for me , and that i hate what i do , and , according to the most common belief , what i  m destined to continue to do until retirement in digit or digit years from now . i have a pretty f  cked up life . if i didn ' t bought into this stupid belief , i can still change this career to something else . the same is with the following beliefs that you have just one career in your lifetime that once you have a family their often not so basic ! needs are more important , and you can  t do anything about it , and you need to suck it up , even if it means climbing the wrong ladder for the rest of your professional life because they rely on your hefty pay check each month that you absolutely need to go to college that you absolutely need to graduate from harvard , because your father graduated from harvard and , by the way , that  s the thing he is most known for in his life that you need to make your parents proud do what they tell you , or what you think they would like to see happen in your life , because they were so good to you and you feel that you can  t let them down , and , as a result , they think they can plan your life for you , that you absolutely need to own a car and buy a new one every three years that you absolutely need to have the same lifestyle your parents have , that you will retire at the predetermined age that that  s what we all eventually do  we will retire  so it  s even unthinkable that you could not plan to retire that you stick to what is tried and true , maintain the status quo and avoid risk because that  s what your parents told you  because that  s what they care about that you sacrifice your life goals , your dreams , for your children because that  s what parents need to do , that you not your children are responsible for securing their best future which is so wrong , by the way ! , that you can  t succeed  achieve your dream because you weren  t born in , say , silicon valley , that you can  t succeed  achieve your dream because your parents didn  t give you what you need , and don  t support you , on and on . of course , life likes to surprise us from time to time . it really does . but most of it , boy it is exactly what we make it and , most importantly , what we first make it in our heads .
   (ID: fed0c0c8b0ae958dd1a6a750f7a4f677f0b34628)

19. when i was old enough to think i realised that the world was not made my magic . everyday scientists chart out the formerly unknown . never once have they said , " ahh . this proves it . magic as we suspected "
   (ID: 2266c34274940e2ea1a22a3dee5a3cbcdad25f53)

20. one where i never got into videogames because games have shaped my personality so much such as making me sociable thanks to speaking online , having something to do every day when i ' m bored ,  have made so many friends from across the world that have lasted nearly a decade . i wonder what kind of person i turned or to be
