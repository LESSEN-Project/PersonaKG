9. yta generally i wouldnt reccomend buying something for other peoples super invested hobbies unless you are equally invested and understand what they would like  want . you are likely to waste money , and in this case its money both of you share through marriage . you also come across as really selfabsorbed in all your replies , refusing to accept the fact that what you did was wrong , and it came from the fact that you have very little clue about what your wife does . im sure your heart was in the right place , but your actions and words speak for themselves
