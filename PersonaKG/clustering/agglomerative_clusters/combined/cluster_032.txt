2. if you get enough yellow cards you can get suspended so he cant just do this every game . not sure if that ' s enough compensation but i see what you ' re saying . people don ' t play the game to do this , it ' s just spur of the moment stuff . i hate it and i ' ve done it plenty of times .
   (ID: 230ce64c825c9de0874b588b6d715819e39e5610)

   (ID: a70e276355baaea2f732281343d3f63ea5d96365)

4. a herobrine event quest with special equipment based on him would be really cool but like somebody else said , it  s not very likely . still a cool idea though !
   (ID: 6f88a57b804dffb05f07ee78e02223947d9055aa)

5. yeah it came full circle with the actual edwin jarvis raising tony at least we can imagine that then lending his name to the ai .
   (ID: 569832646eef001c1724d2ecdb8abedbbfd927ab)

   (ID: 4cd63391f1644eb1dde02717bf6a72fc6c22acc7)

   (ID: 5b16dae030b645e34d7761b41c614a0625c2e1c2)

9. was that my argument ? dr doom will do anything to gain power , his desperation makes him a constant threat to the marvel universe as a whole . whereas dr strange , as stated by eternity , is " more powerful by far than any of your fellow humanoids " i am saying i would rather see a clash of this magnitude than any publication where doom fights the ff .
   (ID: b5153b16e61f6bc5e4bf4d8db479b7093df1ae26)

10. they will never see him coming with that critical damage backstab .

11. at least you can play it . every time i join an ongoing match , my screen just stays black , i can hear everything , i can move , can shoot but i can ' t see anything . but yeah , the introduction is kind of " lagged " .
   (ID: 6573f6a8f26b8c23dc16d278f5c2c32e67af1e5b)

12. no because that whould mean tecnical smash is in the disney universe omg mickey mouse fer smashhhmouse  facemouse  facemouse  facemouse  face nobody wants that and if they do something ludicrous like that years will pass and by smash digit we will have shrek , goku etc what a disgrace to sakurai
   (ID: d34dab0dded997c6aa6e6d2792ea9d8a26881a2b)

13. do you think it ' d work ? maybe , maybe not . the biggest problem is that marcone is assuming that when dresden comes for him it will be a straightforward assault on marcone in a position where marcone has the advantage . harry ' s a lot smarter and sneakier that that . the thing is that marcone as a character is a lot like harry . underpowered compared to some of his enemies , but smart enough to win anyway . a conflict between the two of them is likely to be a lot more like a chess game than a straight  up fight .
   (ID: 5bf69e8a91457991a99f2cc3f9248ca16f27a0d5)

14. i think it ' s more of a celebration than a " get people back into the game " sort of deal .
   (ID: ee6fdc3d42cb3e2a3321054cfa11a7a337437f94)

15. i bet we will see at least one raid as a show of force in the next few weeks .
   (ID: c21f8d5819115eb61914aa55dbbc727a12117bef)

16. never know what country around the world can do to do destruction the worst can be like a bomb full of ebola
   (ID: 3cd6cbd0ced9eeece859e4e31c6ae046d9711c59)

17. i appreciate the ingenuity and new take . there ' s a lot of games out there that just try to repeat what ' s being sold . i hate it
   (ID: 199704b2ab3344a95185dd1a9c09023379518eb0)

18. does anyone else love the fact that all attachments were removed from all weapons ? cuz i sure do ! its fun to spend digit minutes navigating ubisoft ' s shitty menus before playing the game again . i love the way ubisoft thinks .
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

19. hold on hold on hold on you are telling me that while we are probably in one of the most crucial transfer windows in the past decade that ed went on a freaking vacation for digit days ? are you fucking kidding me ? you do realise our potential targets could have slipped through our fingers while you were burning your balls in the sun . get us a freaking dof that works his ass off during transfer window and enjoys some vacation when it ' s all done after all . no wonder ole looked a bit sad when asked about transfers . he ' s busting his ass off to get something going while the boss is slurping margaritas . we needed players to be part of preseason but guess since you have digit understand of football go enjoy your fucking vacation ed . sorry rent over . please continue to your usual muppet duties .
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)
