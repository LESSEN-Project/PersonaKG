Total from this dataset: 193

1. yeah but the way naruto is handled i cant really see a make your legend without having someone really convince him cause every game is true to the story so far and are focused on the big named characters who we have seen do full fights . also i think the issue is the workload a game like that will drop on him to ensure the games gets all the information it needs for jutsu , clans , nations , etc . ugh i ' m making too many points , uh simple explanation is he would need to make a lore for naruto , where as dragonball creator has a full lore for dbz there really isn ' t much plot holes and missing information to detriment a full game like that .
   (ID: 9d6cadbef277b68098e82945a77678dbb2a079c6)

2. i ' d imagine a vast majority of people attempting to get this skin did it in the first few days of it being released , and we saw zero proof of it being unboxed during a time where most superior packs or packs in general were probably being opened . i ' m less likely to believe it actually existed during that time than i am to believe that they simply waited less than a day before notifying players of an increase . as much as i hate to don a tinfoil hat , it ' s also possible that they purposely delayed the tweet just to make it seem like it was actually obtainable before . if anybody went as far as to take some sort of legal action against them for falsely advertising an item as a possible reward in a virtual lottery , delaying the tweet is one way for them to prove themselves innocent .

3. thank god it ' s not on a bigger stage .
   (ID: 3fb1292a0bd26711d797fe1a61e6229794c21b68)

   (ID: 5be7ef463c3ba0c7a9c255bd9769c5f638d2b805)

5. messi dribbling past players
   (ID: 2ea109772fcc0738f65030d7584f4ec864e785dd)

6. bruh fuck you mean when people hunt for sport they often give the meat to someone else
   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

7. i wonder what would happen if for one day they switched what the upvotes and downvotes do .
   (ID: f46d1bfdfed7fc05bbe39789c092019944471e9d)

8. it is extremely common to wear the tshirt of your alma mater . there is nothing douchebaggy about showing a little pride about your loyalties . i suggest the douchebaggery is in ops perception . why is he butthurt anyway ?
   (ID: e3524b3478c664f2c6e8b00a4341ff0a26995fbc)

9. you can ' t convince me this wasn ' t all planned .
   (ID: 7ed1ff576cc7dc77750ed5f15461eb3ccdb52a7a)

10. they probably make movies of them . that ' s not a bad idea !
   (ID: 60d49a425809d6f450335028a75a5202d3b84678)

11. you have no idea how high i can get my hopes
   (ID: 8a914d1b332f7e39fd1f0cbb2c4b483e19f43fd7)

12. i said this on another post , but this really feels like a cheap attempt to keep people collecting the same pokemon . i like the idea of the lucky system , but giving luckies their own pokedex entry makes me think that they did this just to give completionists something else to chase . if they had kept the same system , but instead made it so pokemon had a chance to turn shiny instead of lucky , i think this would be a lot better .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

13. i ' ve got the same opinion really but the truth is your ' never know until the split happens . just out of interest , how to you know it ' s the chinese that are splitting the blockchain to create bcc ?
   (ID: d45001f1fdd37cda488cfddffabec23e83ee7b7e)

15. i hope stark and the captain survive the end game .
   (ID: c813c36bca44bc01c2d3bd131f4f642cf9d9b6d1)

16. absolutely correct , even the ncr and legion started using their own currency , why would the east coast with its abundence of water need caps back by water , its also like a digit year old currency at that point
   (ID: 41a67e67cad6d49fc85ef1ed0bf4549a04d9e027)

17. for me it would have to be a workout montage like rocky . if i could do a week ' s worth of working out within digit minutes , that would make it much more enjoyable .
   (ID: 0ff9b93da34f69dc075bf7e22366843c393b5bdd)

18. the game is too big to die . with all those mods , you can even play just terraria for your entire life . maybe the hype might die and player base will be lower but i don  t think it will die .
   (ID: a0849f7d6d0829c8bb5f820aa9bf63584c7471df)

19. i hear that the jak and daxter series will be on the playstation plus store by december .
   (ID: a70e276355baaea2f732281343d3f63ea5d96365)
