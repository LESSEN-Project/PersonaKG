16. even if your reverse generalizations don ' t hurt anyone because of power imbalances , does that make it morally right to do so ? i think we should try to love each other from both directions . we can complain about inequality righteously without generalizing groups of people . it ' s wrong to generalize anyone , no matter their color , even when the generalized group is powerful enough to not be affected by it . aaaaand let the name  calling begin .
