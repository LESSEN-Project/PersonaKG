1. i went to one and while i do agree that it can stunt social growth when it comes to interacting with women the only reason it affected me is because no one asked me to hang out with them on weekends . all my friends hung out with girls outside of school , there was an all girls school next door . most people here seem to think that social opportunities don ' t exist outside the school gates but as long as my kids do then i can ' t see any reason not to send them to one .
