1. i feel like with many a pizza , if you use wonderful ingredients the pizza will be fine . the difference between fresh and canned pineapple , or breadt an upscale local ham or oscar mayer . i try not to go to places that have hawaiian pizza on the menu because i am a pizza snob and selling hawaiian pizza shows that you dont take pizza seriously and wouldn ' t be inclined to use wonderful ingredients in the first place . but what ' s a deluxe ? mushroom , onion , green pepper , sausage , pepperoni ?
   (ID: 85ac769b0cb349e567cb91e8109645bd1ac28b9f)

   (ID: 96b1ed1f8b952d8d999a49615ef255ff337e17ab)

3. no offence taken , it ' s not just about the pvp , it ' s also about farming , which is fine if that ' s how others want to play . i was of the understanding that fw was about conflict and dominating the enemy , this can be pretty hard if the enemy just warps off when i turn up , if you ' re at ' war ' then be at ' war ' . i can understand why these ideas may not be for you in particular , but maybe , just maybe , a lot of others may be just as frustrated as me and actually want to have some gf ' s . i like different points of view as sometimes brilliant ideas can evolve , how  what would you like to see done to improve fw ?
   (ID: a911ed792d3b26b115aedaee6218a4a944c38521)

4. commenting unironically with only emojis
   (ID: 137d64f4a858b21d0854639ebc037d0bd1dc557f)

5. just relax . masturbating is supposed to be fun . how could it ever be fun doing it the way you ' re doing it ? how is it possible not get off from your own mind creating things and scenarios , that you sexually desire ? i ' m just gonna say " bullshit " everyone loves daydreaming about sex . so if you can ' t turn yourself on mentally  don ' t enjoy doing that , and you also don ' t like porn i call bullshit again why the fuck are you even trying to masturbate ? are you sure that ' s what you ' re doing ? i ' m just fucking with ya don ' t get all butthurt now lol of course you can ' t orgasm . in order to get " off " you first have to learn to get " on " masturbation is a natural fluid process , one that shouldn ' t ever take this much effort . you ' re fucking yourself from fucking yourself . stop it .
   (ID: deb51648159c9d9d915a701d8f77ac885a29b9b4)

11. are you against lying ? would you lie to save someone ' s life ? are you against murder ? do you accept that perhaps hitler should have been killed prior to his inauguration ? etc . contradiction is a completely regular aspect of human existence , embrace it or go insane i think . the implication of your comment would be to throw all morals and ethics out the window . i assume that ' s not your actual position , despite it being what you said .

14. this is enlightened . complaining is not the same as soliciting advice . so often a child ' s minor complaint about something gets a response telling them what they did wrong , just making the kid feel bad .
   (ID: b18c6165a76bf34665eb406698860d1ddc5e2cbf)

15. you ' re quite literally missing out on half of your potential friends , i ' m serious , having female friends as well as male is amazing and won ' t be weird unless someone makes it weird .
   (ID: ef9684680c857510e817ec197ee0615d70b29022)

16. lol . who ' s trying to save face . my original post was not meant to be taken seriously . other people understood that , or were less inclined to jump into a discussion with the " i know something about something obvious to anyone with a high school education   so let me ' correct ' you " vibe we all love so much around here . you also clearly didn ' t read the thread .
   (ID: 17b8a304069d7530607e28f8e04d840e28be0d3e)

17. i also didn  t say that , but yes he  s not a good person . dude you have assumed so much of me without ever explicitly saying anything about those subjects lol
   (ID: c0f309bee7152ab458da8ec03fbb1e17fa2876cd)

18. not playing into your hand or giving you the answers you want is not avoiding questions . i have answered each question you asked , if you don ' t like the answers stop asking the questions . once again you think you will paint me into in a corner . you cannot . you will find yourself wanting if you continue to play your social justice warrior , validation game with me .
   (ID: 4a7a47c2e5a0426b71a637dd821ac57f06afeedf)

19. i am ? i answered the question  what ' s one crazy rich person thing would you love to do ? you are the one downvoting me and telling me how stupid it is .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

20. imagine somebody that bores you to tears . now imagine the most interesting conversation you have ever had . attraction is when you can ' t tell the difference .
