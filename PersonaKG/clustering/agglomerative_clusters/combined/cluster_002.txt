14. i have a feeling we don ' t know the full story on how succession works with supreme kais and gods of destruction . how come it ' s shin linked to beerus , and not this ? he was higher up the pecking order of kais , seems like the natural choice for a god of destruction to be linked to . we ' ve seen that kais train successors , and there have been hints that beerus  whis wanted gokvegeta i forget which to become a god of destruction . so maybe they ' re not immortal beings , so much as chosen powerful people who have some magic done on them to link them and balance creation and destruction . with this in mind , nobody would have cared that much if buu had killed shin . just pick up with the next in line for supreme kai , and train up a new god of destruction .
