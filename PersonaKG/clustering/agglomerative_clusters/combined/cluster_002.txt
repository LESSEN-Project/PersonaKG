1. little mom and pop run by their also drug addict son who would take anything from me to sell online  to his friends . even the stuff that was obviously stolen  illegal to sell to pawnshops that he ' d keep off record once i started going regularly . i got stiffed on a lot of the prices but he was the only one that would take some stuff so it was better than nothing
   (ID: 128e913d04941bcfe472d443c137eda644ab7e31)

2. my mum taught me to lie to my dad about how much she spent on clothes from an early age . he knew we were lying and never challenged it . not sure why she insisted on lying about everything she bought , my dad couldn  t have cared less . nice memories
   (ID: 90eb51492399cbfe8bbde2fd7d291e5e115a59db)

3. i am already electing to not have biological kids because i don ' t want them to have to face this reality . i wouldn ' t be surprised if humans kill ourselves off in the next hundred years . " oh but did you see this adorbs cat video " facepalm
   (ID: c1c3bee034ba3e70e4bd22d7987533e43f2b424b)

4. what if i told you that you could have a new , better mom . a mom that isn  t alright with serving poison .
   (ID: 841a375b464a5650f1c027d1c7ae73415228c6ab)

5. this might just be my experience , but with the younger crowd , jazz has really lost its seductive luster and now just sounds like you ' re trying way too hard to be suave . i don ' t know your situation and i ' m sorry i don ' t have any suggestions , but yeah , jazz sadly doesn ' t wet panties like it used to .
   (ID: 3994e1d32967dee02bf170d70c0ccc2d7dbd99d5)

6. ok , now i can go on land , but i have to go back into the water to have babies
   (ID: 7f37146b5301f541de969be8882a7963d3ad1298)

7. yeah the more time i spend with my niece and nephew makes me realize that having my own offspring is a major missing piece in my life
   (ID: 3c405c5b13146831496e429cf2aff978fcec01eb)

8. it really depends on where you live . some places require behind the wheel experience prior to getting a license , and the amount varies . do you live in a city with public transportation ? do you have friends or access to uber to get around ? what about a bicycle ? i would recommend trying to calmly talk to your parents about these things . maybe let them know that you do not want to move out the day you turn digit , but you will need certain freedoms to agree to stay . please don ' t speak angrily or sound like a threat . just explain what you want and listen to their side . maybe you can get a compromise .
   (ID: 9186c179fe844e912b1dc4e064693a023e668de3)

9. as a retired teacher i ask . are you doing too much of your kids ' work ? the ideas should come from them . you are a very cool dad though !
   (ID: 128346fc1e56ccadd25a4b200ecae44637d48f5f)

10. i am childfree , although , i think being a parent is the most selfish thing a person can do . it takes a lot of effort to drive your kid to school everyday , caring for them when they ' re sick , spending so much money so they could go to college and have a bright future . i know some parents don ' t do all these things , but raising a child is definitely exhausting and selfless . i don ' t think i could do it .
   (ID: e28ddc799fe165a883ff107b6718627ae1ecc7e4)

11. regardless of the selfishness in your ideas , which caused the existance of the kids in the first place , in going to say that my point is , that you cant expect kids to be slaves because you provide them food and shelter . " i give you shit , so you should do exacly as i say " that sounds like a regular employment , except the kids can ' t quit . they have to put up with you . and they dont even realise that because you have fashioned their brains the way you want . im digit and took me digit years and living away from home to realise that parents are the entitled ones . i hope for the sake of kids , fair doesn ' t only come in octomber to your house too .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

12. just our silly gift exchange . we pick a theme for the year . it has been  something from a truck stop , something blue , something homemade , your favorite song on a cdhad to explain what those were to the kids and then a quiz to guess whose was whose . things like that . usually we all pick a gift , open them , then have a dice rolling game where everyone gets one chance to steal another ' s present ! we have a large family , so getting one present is way easier and just so much more fun and it takes the commercial aspect out of the holiday and makes it more about our family being together and doing the usual silly shit we do together .
   (ID: a478495540bd8a55b1578497b1e3790b4038b27a)

13. i didn ' t . i just got drugs from my psychiatrist . now i hate everybody and think how stupid humanity is .
   (ID: 080eedcfaabe8f67b2c0a8da33a3a401906822f2)

14. yeah , they live digit hours away from my job , what else would i do with it ?
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

15. don ' t say " it ' s cool " to something you feel is not cool , better to say nothing , in my opinion . if i had been in your position i think i would have said something like " don ' t apologize to me , apologize to him . " and continued on my way . the time or two that i have seen a parent enter that electrified frustration zone i ' ve offered to help by saying " we ' ve all been there , are you okay , can i help ? " usually when the kid sees that someone else has noticed they ' ll stop the misbehavior and quiet down really fast . it also breaks the parent ' s tension . i think it ' s very cool that a digit year old would ask this question . i think your parents probably did a good job raising you and i think that someday you ' ll make a good parent too .
   (ID: 1293e72aa7301baf0ecb3a2509e46cdcca834cd9)

16. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far
   (ID: 68b48505d5f7a16cf14847c82fff612e6bd59090)

17. i didn ' t say i didn ' t care for my friends , i said i ' m only obligated to provide care for my child . not paying for my friends things through tax money does apply to them as well . i don ' t want to be forced to give charity . that ' s theft . if my friends need help , they should come to me and other friends and family members for help . i don ' t have any adult children , but in digit years when my son becomes a legal adult , if he is unable to get affordable health insurance , then i will help him , granted i ' m still alive and able to do so . that ' s what parents do . and i do have an employer provided insurance plan . i am ok that they use my money to pay for other patients ' procedures because i can opt out of it if i choose to .
   (ID: 695ad7129ad4566e5fbe988279cd914c2bff0ce9)

18. i sleep fine weirdo . young men are useless in the world . try to accept it , because it ' s not going to change .
   (ID: b386bb7f54bebf7edfe66a27e8d881a61bd1d6df)

19. when my dad beat me in a corner , it made me aware i shouldn  t piss him off . disclaimer  this is digit  a joke
   (ID: bd0712716940e41d4901cd77632c868dc43fa8f0)

20. mum doesn ' t let me drink i ' m so mad i ' m going to live with dad !  s
