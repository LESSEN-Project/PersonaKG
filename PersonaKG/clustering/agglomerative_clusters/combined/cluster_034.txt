10. because of a thing called the public domain . in the olden days , there was such a thing as copyright , but it was only about digit years time before their works were released into the public domain . now that disney owns everything , they lobbied congress to extend the time before an artist ' s work is released to the pd , therefore , nobody can use any of disney ' s works for inspiration . let us use a real  life situation to explain our " sane and well  thought  out " copyright laws . granny smith has digit apples . little johnny downloaded digit copies of the apples without her permission . granny smith still has digit apples . johnny then ate one of the copies , while the other copy sat on his hard drive . mary sue used spyware to steal a copy of the copy on johnny ' s computer . she then gave copies of these copies to people in her carpool . granny smith still has digit apples . mary sue ' s car was hit by a train going from new york to chicago going 100km  hr . apple farmers pushed for stricter regulations and granny smith was sentenced to digit years in prison and now the entire apple industry is now . rotten to the core .
