1. i owned a shibari and put it through it ' s paces quite . vigorously . it lasted digit years . i finally had to buy a new one , it ' s a great stepping stone if you want to find out if wand  style vibrators are for you . doxy here i come .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

2. the amount of shit liberty gives about older fans . if you really were an " older fan " you would remember bridgestone used this exact same system with a " soft " and " hard " tyre and it worked perfectly fine , and before that you wouldn ' t have a clue what the competing tyre companies brought to a race .
   (ID: c4e208aabc60c608a4d517ef7c7c76bd230e7f40)

3. and literally what do you have to show for it now ? that ' s why i quit video games . they are a distraction honestly . could be focusing on so many bettecooler things in life .
   (ID: 4a5a9ac8eab027b38804427b3c8c5e19c8991de3)

4. the controls suck terribly optimised for controller . i am struggling to do basic things like control my phone in game . just terrible , please wait for an update so they dont thino this is ok
   (ID: a2ca7f9e05e83928ce894848f01290dbcd0f654e)

5. name the tool something you will keep so that you don  t leave it behind for digit emeralds , something like an axe or a sword
   (ID: 3418702de52d65ee261943b207996da3e2569fd2)

6. probably current patch apart from very minor changes . they rightfully so don ' t want to change the meta a lot right before such a big tourny .
   (ID: d8952166e450f1d7d75495d86ed516c2376f79bc)

7. One of my favorite things is masquerade-esque events in games.
   (ID: 127d601df381c9f971eae1e3fd42953571015813)

8. activeselfprotection . makes you very aware of what can go wrong and how to deal with it . it can save your life someday .
   (ID: cfd691d6aeaf46cc644b0e21187d10dfc62b0bc8)

9. i don ' t mean balance as in the character meta , but in the community sense . more people are on equal footing . and yeah i agree the prices are ridiculous but unfortunately i don ' t think it ' ll change to much . i wish they would do a system like injustice where you could buy most characters for the farmable currency , but some would be event based

10. i can understand grabbing raiga , it saved time to create the seven ninja swordsmen of the mist for the 3rd generation i think . even though hes like a clone of zabuza . answer to your question to my knowledge no . raiga is the only originally anime  exclusive character to be integrated into the naruto manga , along with his weapon , kiba .

11. shadow assault is unquestionably the least desirable . it ' s not a ' bad ' , heroic in reality , vp is just fantastic . most of the other less than desirable heroics i can think of niche use for , but that ' s the most difficult one . the other two that come to mind are rain of chaos which is decent for zoning during a push , and mind control can be used for picks in some cases . i wouldn ' t recommend picking them most of the time , but you can come up with situations where they are pretty decent . abby ' s construct blanking out on the name , is good and bad in so far that if not stopped it can do a lot of damage . it limits his team  fight potential though , so unless your team can compensate in some other ways it can be difficult to use properly . it has high potential though , and under the right circumstances is arguably superior .

12. best value for the money for a novice is the players pure x cue . seyberts they will prolly run you 180ish with digit . 75mm i believe ldc shaft with a kamui soft tip on them . i have been using mine for digit months and i have nothing but good things to say . you can also buy the shaft separately or any other shaft which i think is a good option as well for you if you really like your butt . me personally i like to look at and touch all different butts

13. i would like to join a raiding guild for legion but what if the spec i want to play is not the top spec for that class ? are you going for world first ? no ? then no one will care . play what ' s fun . edit  typo

14. the issue was that he jungled non  stop regardless of . well , anything whilst also coming up with a terrible gpm . of course jungling and farming is a high priority for am but you want to be pushing waves more than hitting neutrals .

15. just make a new character ! that  s part of the game ! learning and trying new builds ! just re  level another character ! it  s endless excuses over at that community when the fact of the matter is  the game is complicated for the sake of being complicated . plus , the story  theme  tone is nothing great like diablo digit and digit were . poe is not a valid replacement for diablo in my eyes .

16. or maybe it ' s because if i dont see the opportunity to hatchet them then i will hit them ?

17. i feel like i need to say something here so i will . all three games are phenomenal . when i think of a souls game i think of challenging gameplay . dark souls digit was my first game and i loved the shit out of that game , still do and plan on getting the remastered when it comes out . tried demon souls but it would constantly break on me so i just quit . played through dark souls digit and due to the changes in combat was given the chance to better myself and git gud again . it had a beautiful world that made you question wtf was going on . it had a plot that was there only if you took the time to look . these things to me are what make a souls game a souls game . i just started playing three recently and i  d guess i  m about digit  digit of the way through the game from what i know about it . its fucking awesome starting out already knowing how the combat works . but because of this , i can  t git gud at it because i was already good at it when i started . i beat gundyr first try . dark souls digit took away what i wanted from a souls game , to be able to proudly say that i got good enough at the game to beat the everloving shit out of it . don  t get me wrong i  m absolutely having a blast playing it , and i definitely wouldn  t call it a bad game . digit and digit feel like adventures , while digit , much like its predecessor demon souls , feels like i  m just playing a game to get to the end , kinda like chores almost . finally , how in the actual fuck are you gonna say digit isn  t a souls game ? have you fucking played it ? have you beaten it ? it  s just as much a souls game as demon souls and bloodborne . in fact dark souls digit is more a demon souls remake than a dark souls digit sequel , they just threw in the same item descriptions and a couple characters from digit . if you think dark souls digit is the purest form of souls which it is than digit , being totally open with a vast array of ways to start is more like dark souls digit than digit is . there it is , my thoughts on the matter . downvotes welcome here smiling  face  with  sunglasses

18. with a few exceptions tv has sucked for many years now . the so called " reality " shows are not even close to being real , the so called " talent " shows suck buffalo assholes . radio is just as bad and there are so many fucking commercials it ' s unlistenable .
   (ID: c69ba20c8286f807f6219a451e4448f951938f31)

19. i honestly love the dc now that i ' m not in a trailer anore . it ' s just a bunch of digit year olds training eachother on power equipment . what could possibly go wrong ?
   (ID: 1885b01dd0970230fea2a9c9ae9c4eaeaceb59a3)

20. just a quick question  why not make the " vik " something closer to a kashtan ? it would certainly make the dreadnaughts much scarier since this is hfy . you would need to reduce the number probably but it would look much better in my head .
