4. but we  re speaking about a human life here , and one that although still has problems . has a place in my heart . i would rather not take the gamble of just  throwing her away  to losing her life , she  s not a bad person as i said . but is there some way i can situate this to where i can leave her but in a better way , for her and i ?

5. that ' s a good theory , but i wouldn ' t discount him overpowering her so easily . i ' m not a small girl , but when i was sexually assaulted by a drunk man who was over digit years old and smaller than me i was barely able to fight him off . if i ' d been as drunk as kristin smart apparently was that night , i have no doubt that it would have been a rape i experienced rather than an attempted rape . it happened in the middle of a sunday afternoon , in a residential area and no one heard a thing , or if they did they didn ' t do anything about it . it ' s a hell of a lot easier to overpower a woman than we ' d like to think .

   (ID: e1d1404c2d4f1c884debe976d40ee13df3959fcf)
