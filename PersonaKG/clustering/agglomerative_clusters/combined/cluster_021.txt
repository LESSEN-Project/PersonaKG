1. no , i think you start as something like an atheist , tell me as a kid how well did you grasp the concept of god ? until you can comprehend the concept you aren ' t going to get anything out of it as a individual .
   (ID: 5033a9b064a9790931d6db4cc634e02af206bbb1)

2. not really . you can ' t change what people think . however you should be mindful of people ' s opinions in a professional sense . you obviously don ' t wanna be like , fuck the world when you ' re trying to do well at work .
   (ID: 9752134be7e238e288a9b1afaac48b7b74abd056)

3. where did you gather that i think everyone owes me something ? last time i checked friendships are a two way street . i get what you  re saying bro , but you don  t and never will know the extent of my friendships with these people . and just for the future , there are nicer ways of getting this point across . maybe think twice next time you call a suicidal person a  douche who thinks everything is a fucking gift  .
   (ID: 651fd225d5db46e0521fde62bb39cae1bc5ab942)

4. the only difference is you sound like your experience is from page digit while mine is from raising a daughter after many failed relationships as a teenager , hence my clumsy attempt at telling the young team how life works . i may not come across like it but i am the voice of experience . i  ve lived it
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

   (ID: 472084017072e7ced5fed0827bae57ba801d9b7d)

6. people who do this piss me off . because you don ' t know what my life is it could be tired for any reason that i didn ' t tell you about because it ' s none of your business , doesn ' t matter if i don ' t have kids if you didn ' t want your children why did you have sex . lol ya know ?
   (ID: 97c35f21c6a14bb50b6faae9a7b18cd5968c350c)

7. because deep down we hate ourselves and we would rather suffer than enjoy the good stuff , so we ruin it ourselves for ourselves .
   (ID: 34e16cd86d5bc21047f9df5b5328f8eabdebff2a)

8. i might just be more used to being around people of my own , not that i specifically dislike another
   (ID: dc000fb877b86a0bbd3d65fe6040b512b4f5b042)

   (ID: 2623e4996f6df0e5814dbede4fbc9c1f13de4382)

11. i  m way better at talking online and stuff than in person cause i get time to edit my thoughts and refine them somewhat but when you  re in person there  s no deleting a sentence or rephrasing , it  s like pen vs pencil and i  ve always absolutely predicted pencils especially when i try to do art
   (ID: b67c2fd697e30c5d26fcd88baa61d8bbcce5ec1c)

12. i know this deviates from the question a little but i don ' t ever thank a god for the good things in my life because i believe , a long time ago , the idea of a god was turned into a method of controlling the masses by organized religions and churches . whenever someone thanks god for the great things in their life , i just wanna scream , " why can ' t we appreciate human worth and accomplishment for once " pretty much any luxury or innovation that exists today we can thank a human for . a simple human being did something amazing ! i just believe that we shouldn ' t waste our time worshipping some thing we have never seen for our accomplishments when we could spend our time thanking each other and ourselves . also , if there is a god , why in the hell should we worship it ? our god is terrible ! why would a perfect , omniscient , all powerful being create things like cancer , disease in general , mutation , negativity anger , rage , sadness , fear , hatred , or even pain or death ? and why would it ask us to worship it for making those things ? that is a selfish , cruel god that ignores the " rules " it set forth upon its creations .
   (ID: 37aa751f14bbf132fc2f76d2c2c79142318c3e31)

13. i guess the question should be are they saying " nice work " on objectively average work as a compulsion to be nice , or are they saying " nice work " to everyone any time their work is objectively above average ? that ' s the difference . i give a lot of compliments , but i never give one i don ' t sincerely mean . you ' re welcome to your opinion , but i think you ' re wrong .
   (ID: b3ce8c3aa09031bfd6d4fa7836489539a481a3f4)

14. i think that ' s some social anxiety or something . i don ' t know anyone who would think someone not saying anything was rude or weird . if you really feel like you ' re forced into talking to people to avoid awkwardness , why don ' t you simply replace questions you know the answers to with questions you don ' t , and are relevant to wherever you are  whatever you are doing ?
   (ID: da8d242a2ef9e6771a4964064d74aba8c4e89aa0)

15. hehehe , whatever you do , don ' t be yourself
   (ID: 795c678726f71492166b6677c955ce0a48a9b294)

16. i only say oof to my closer friends and it  s because i don  t know what to say at the time , because i am in the same boat .
   (ID: 404d4f663681fcf738d043296148ae4de655b22b)

17. you say this until you need them .
   (ID: ba841e2486d1df5b5baefde5ead0636c7c03c79c)

18. which language they speak when we introduce ourselves to each other
   (ID: b17b749ab40d1d24eba7d45337d86aeb3c5b28df)

19. don ' t wanna over  pry but any particular reason you stayed with these guys if you weren ' t super into them ? or was it just early on in the relationship so there wasn ' t an attachment yet ?
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

20. when i hear women talk about how much guys are pieces of shit but then thry see and tell me they are my little holes . fuck me man .
