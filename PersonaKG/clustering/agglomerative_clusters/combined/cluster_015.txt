1. the connections you make can be more important than the things you learn in the classroom . so if there are clubs and internships related to the job you want do them . look for jobs that have skills related to what you want to do , or can at least sell to your future employer . the worst ? you find out you hate what you are going into but can change to something else before you are too invested ! the best ? valuable connections that will help you get where you want to go . remember , its not what you know its who you know .
   (ID: 213f629dfbc5d6e1a065cffce0f81b825e4467de)

   (ID: 0217046a1ad9b1e567109f7f7a4bb8b9f4b4fc05)

5. go , why the hell not ? just be smart and have a plan to gtfo if everything goes south midway through . i think you should tell someone you ' re going , a friend an adviser or someone you can count on if it goes to shit . you will regret not going .
   (ID: f4e4929bb0bef09e7eb72aaccf20c2d9454729c7)

6. we welcome everyone to help with all our community projects ! i may type boldly at you if you deviate from the blueprints that are in my head thus only i can see them . but for now , this project is on hold . we are on a temporary map after the beta update . once we are on our permanent map , i ' ll get going again on it .

7. i ' m a slytherin , but i never understood why as everyone describes me as really sweet . one day there was a harry potter trivia on , i assumed i ' d win or come at least second on third , as for the past few themed trivia ' s i ' ve been to half of the people attending didn ' t actually know the material or care . well for this trivia i swear every harry potter nerd was out of their bedroom . thankfully it was going for two nights , so i book the next night and of course being there before i knew all the answers . i also had to pay for dinner again to do this by the way . but i refused to loose and the prize they were giving out goes really well on my shelf .

   (ID: 3158d7c63f10e871a80f147fb47725c8714163c7)

10. i have no advice , as i am in a very similar boat . i ' m digit and have digit years in admin , hate it , am considering a new career but have no idea what to do . i too love reading and writing but don ' t want to pursue writing full time for the reasons you mentioned . i just wanted to say that you are not alone . there are so many people our age who feel unfulfilled with their current career and feel that it could be too late to start a new one . it isn ' t . think about the average life span . we have a whole lot of life to live , it ' s never too late to pursue happiness . have you ever considered that for people like us , perhaps there will be no aha moment ? some people simply don ' t have digit purpose to devote their lives to . that can be so scary because it can leave you feeling restless , directionless and lost . i watched a ted talk that referred to this as being a " multi potentialite . here ' s the link if you care to check it out  maybe you should do some searching . find what naturally gives you joy . it doesn ' t matter if it ' s a profession , a hobby or an interest that captures your attention . identify things that you are excited to do and go from there . some of the happiest people found their dream job completely on accident while just doing something they love . i hope that rambling helped some . best of luck to you !

11. I'm interested in neurology.
   (ID: db585f1dbaa42a5cff4c6b3dbc242bf7ea45bd9a)

12. yeah i would definitely go to diagon alley if i could .  and once your kid starts writing you letters about the amazing experience they ' re having at school , i imagine you would relax a bit . that ' s true , but i would still keep in mind that kids are kids , they will ooh ' s and aah ' s at probably everything they ' re showed but they aren ' t necessarily aware of the danger surrounding them . take the basilisk or the dementors as examples , were muggle parents even informed about that kind of stuff ? because if so there ' s digit chance they would allow their kids to go back at that school , dumbledore or not really .
   (ID: a80b8bc356414690d849369456d68876c95d5518)

13. i actually went to ' school ' to learn about cannabis in all forms . i learned the compounds , the process in growing from seed to fully matured and ready to harvest . i ' d say learn as much as you can . i managed a shop almost four years ago . then , there were a lot of business with different products . also , testing is a big deal . you can ' t truly recommend something to a patient without having some experience with it , too . in working in this industry , i ' ve learned there are real people who need real help . learn what you can to help them . good luck !
   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

14. when you say to attend , you  re speaking with a bit of certainty that you  ll be getting into those programs . how confident do you feel on those chances ? even if the chances are low , i do believe it  s up to you and what you  re looking to do in the future . what do you really want . if academia is more important to you than becoming a clinician , declining an acceptance may not be the worst idea . but it is ultimately up to you and what you see for your future , and that is what will give you the most fulfillment later on in your life .

15. absolutely go with him . good odds on what he ' s offering is better than what i have now . bonus  if it sucks there , too , at least i had a transitional period of hope before business as usual .

16. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?

19. here is my " signal group " , for the low price of  digit . digit you can be the first to jinx my winning streak . seriously though , i , , , i , . so if you want " free scalping signals " you ' re welcome to follow aside from that , i too once figured i would try to use a signal group . then , my own trading experience kinda taught me that why would anyone " sell " signals . why not just make the money from those signals . sure , you can do both , hell if your signals are legit and ppl pay top dollar i could see it . however its almost impossible to sort the bs from the non  bs . that ' s why i try to be transparent and post my trades almost as soon as i take them sometimes i get busy or i try to average  manage in which adds delay i would love to put as much distance between myself and shill groups that front run their signals . i don ' t even want to be a signal pusher , just someone that puts out some good resources , i just find that i need some " legitimacy " behind it , the best way i can think of that is by being transparent with my positions . i trade options too which i ' m not as good at but bring in more    shh , don ' t tell crypto fans .  i  m interested in trying other ones , but don  t want to pay the price tag for another  experiment  , i want something that is sending great signals for when i don  t have time to analyse charts on my own , and one with a good community that i can continue to learn from . i don ' t know if that ' s a thing my man . i don ' t want to tell you what to do or not do but i will say i think it would be more productive for you if you dedicated that time to doing basic researching and ta so you can quickly look at a chart and say almost exactly what any signal group would say . i kid you not , i " work " on charts maybe digit minutes a day . i know of dudes that wake up , screen for trades , take a position and do nothing while the money comes in or out if you ' re bad thanks for your post though , i always wondered the experience of signal groups . you were able to shed some light on them ! in any case , glhf !
