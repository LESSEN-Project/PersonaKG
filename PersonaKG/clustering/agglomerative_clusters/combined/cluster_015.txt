7. my first run with de bulbs is actually right now . i prefer to use 1000w digital ballast with magnum hoods a light spreader and hortilux super hps bulb in flower . i keep my lights between digit  digit " away from my plants . and i pull them off around day digit of digit  digit to digit  digit " away . i lollipop before flower but i do not lollipop in flower . the whole point is you don ' t want to lollipop during flower . you don ' t want to defoliate because fan leaves carry vital nutrients that the plant will need for it ' s long term health . the reason you can defoliate late in flower is because you want those nutrients gone anyways after you flush , and you are trying to get your plant to use up all the nutrients it has stored in it ' s roots and leaves . prior to flush , you are trying to promote the greatest growth possible . when you train plants in veg , you are increasing the amount of tops you have which increases yields because the biggest determining factor is the amount of surface area that the light hits without dissipating too fast . which is why you just bend the fan leaf down if it is in the way of the light i really don ' t think i should have to pull sources to prove my point when this should all be common sense from a growing standpoint by year digit of growing . to say my grow was low maintenance is true , but that is also because i know how to manipulate plantslight stress . my battle was yield per square foot , plant counti tried to keep it below digit per house , amperagei only had one house at digit amps the rest had digit and space available for growing . before you knock me on a multiple house grow , they would actually be considered mansions and the rent was about  digit a month per house5 houses . the reason i didn ' t go commercial building is because it was an illegal grow and i thought the cops would only be smart enough to bust one house at a time . i now give them the benefit of the doubt instead of thinking they are dumb . i didn ' t spend any time trimming . i had a trimming machine which was the greatest investment i ever made growing . btw i would be more than happy to pull sources for you , if you can show me a single knowledgeable grow book that says you should lollipop in the middle of flower . all you have to do is google simple things and the answer is right there ! just try to stick to . gov , . org or . edu sites for more accurate information . so if i have a plant that i didn ' t top , and tried to scrog it into a 4x4 tent  space you are telling me it would only take digit  7days more to fill out the same space with a topped plant ? i tried it a few years ago because i still wanted that fat digit oz cola , but decided the difference in yield because of canopy structure and the amount of extra time in veg was not worth the main cola . instead i stick to 7g tops and digit  8x 20g colas .
   (ID: e978c4c5dd931b8985b65369abe1ef855c833aa3)

8. i hate when people do this . just because you love and trust your dog does not mean everyone else does . the reality is that a loose dog running toward you or your children is frightening .

9. One of my favorite things is santner.

10. the reason the different categories exist is because some pets they don ' t have the time or interest in making the necessary animations for them to overrides , every pet that they don ' t make the animations for become followers instead . i do wish they ' d stop releasing new pets as followers because they ' re universally ignored if they can ' t be used for overrides , but hey they ' re a lot cheaper to produce and pad out the content so jagex likes them .
   (ID: 818321ef6a71106a1a86010b5df8bc2991279431)

11. i think the idea of furries existing alongside domesticated animals is kind of the go to explanation that most fiction writers use . it ' s the one that seems to make the most sense . but yeah , when fiction writers diverge from the formula , it ' s often annoying when they don ' t fill in the new gaps they ' ve created in their world . although with a world full of anthropomorphic creatures , i suppose there ' s lots that just has to remain unexplained and assumed . using another example from a series  we still don ' t have any freakin ' idea how the hell pokeballs work .
