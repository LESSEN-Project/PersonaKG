1. i  m not sure what the limit is , but there is some value of goods that you  re allowed to bring in as personal luggage that is allowable as tax free . if you  re worried you can voluntarily declare it and see what they say , but probably smarter to check the regulations online first . if you  re below the allowed value then don  t bother declaring since it isn  t required , but keep the receipt and maybe a printed copy of the regulations in case you get stopped .
   (ID: d8e39e092041fc01f24bedce425d10f55bd2a764)

13. chances are , the package was ripped open by a conveyer and that  s also why it  s scratched up . don  t worry about someone looking at your package with or without a warrant , they don  t have time for that anyway . this time of year there are millions of packages being shipped daily and i  m sure the people at the post office don  t have time to be opening your package to see what  s in it . i would contact the seller and see if you can get a replacement for it since it happened before it was in your possession . if a firearms company can  t replace a barrel that they probably paid  digit to make , then sell that one and by another somewhere else . on the other hand , just use the thing . it  s going to get scratched up if you actually use it anyway .

15. those are the kind you want to avoid . they will chop up your buds , those are specifically the kind that i would avoid personally . i ' m pretty sure i had the one with the leather straps on it and used it for an year before selling . you should be able to find one with the top for around  digit . it was  digit like digit years ago . but avoid it if you can . if you have to trim 10lbs it might be worth it , but if you can avoid it don ' t get it .
