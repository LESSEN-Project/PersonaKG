--- PER-CHAT ---
Total from this dataset: 253

1. i have no idea about what happened to you . i can only comment on my own experiences . the staff i worked with only medicated patients at a physician request . they are the only ones that could legally prescribe . all medication drawn and administered is documented , heavily . so no one in my organization could " knock you out " simply because they thought you were a burden . it doesn ' t work that way . as for restraints , if you become a danger to yourself , staff or any other patient then for safety reasons you will be restrained . depending on the state or province the form of restraint will vary . some units will use handcuffs , others just simple velcro straps . any properly regulated hospital will ensure that restraints or even isolation units for that matter are used for positive outcome . never as a punishment . i ' m not going to say it doesn ' t happen because i know it does but for the most part in my experience things were always by the book . i can only speculate about your experience . if you did try to leave the facility and you were a level one psych patient then meds would likely be given even after restraints were placed . the number one thing is to keep you safe . if that means sedation then that ' s what ' s going to happen . maybe to get your vitals back or to help you sleep .
   (ID: 96ea4e7f6c3452a58ef71fc7276006fdbf2ccb01)

2. smile and such , it ' s proven sorry won ' t bother with links that when you laugh or do similar stuff you will be happier . i know it is work but still , worth it .
   (ID: e57ef54aa6b4e23fcfbf5b034403be21a86f9700)

3. stay up when my body is begging me to sleep
   (ID: 18cbf1c145fcc3d10b99255dd1de8fb616ecb38f)

4. literally shit your pants at the doctor ' s office . you ' ll get as many notes as you want .
   (ID: bb09bb4d1ee02a280e54d9e3a1e7ac9498e6e809)

5. probably not rest and recuperate .
   (ID: 6faff6ad4f2fa64f202b2b60f154aba162159b2f)

6. i guess if they just seem very different from usual or you can see something physically wrong with them

11. i was at a large music festival near london with a group of friends . we had set up our tents on the first day and were sitting around drinking and meeting our new neighbours . later in the day i had to go to the main entrance to meet one of our group who had just arrived . it was about digit minutes walk . when i met him he was carrying a broken false leg which he had somehow acquired on the journey to the festival . typical festival wackiness . when we got back to our tent area , our friends were talking with one of our new neighbours . neighbour guy sees the false leg , looks inside , and proudly announces  yep , this is one of mine  . it transpires that neighbour guy had been telling my friends about his interesting line of work  he made false legs . he had just finished explaining that he could identify any of his creations by checking some kind of id that can be found inside each model . and this is the exact moment i return . with a false leg . a false leg that he apparently made . this was digit years ago and i still don  t understand how this happened . even if he didn  t really make the leg , i think it would still be pretty weird .
   (ID: ed9fd9ff218602605c7fbdf8f02f658604680c61)

12. i ' m generally against shaming suicide because they clearly feel bad enough to kill themselves already , but if you have kids and you kill yourself you ' re no better than a someone who abandons their kids for any other reason .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

13. basic human being  after seeing you post this in here it is making me think more of your original post above . i thought at first it was a bit of a joke due to the owl reference but seeing you actually engage with the same story in another thread it  s making it more believable for me . as for op then maybe you digit are experiencing something strange as i  ve never heard of this owl thing before and i did a bit of research into ufo , aliens and abductions so please post updates as i  m really enjoying this sub reddit atm so thanks

14. i didn ' t necessarily ' disappear ' but i moved several times until i was unknown by anyone in my ' new ' life . on the occasions i ' ve been passing through places my old life existed it was strange to see that actually very little had changed . if cloning could be done , i ' d probably replace myself in this life with a clone and go again . but hey ho .
   (ID: 13351a02e20f4adf8ac13d71b9b8887cf8b7bb2c)

15. have been depressed for god knows how long and never got any treatment . neither can i afford ot nor do i think that it will help because the treatments are shit aroud here .
   (ID: a0430b9e9d663be002c794e513ad3a0135307e6c)

16. this happens to me as well , unfortunately . there are special sensitive skin removal instructions but that hasn ' t worked for me either . honestly , it ' s a decision i have to make between being able to walk and a rash which leads to a chemical burn on my skin .
   (ID: ca13e283de9a99b9eb1cf4f68eed33eccff74e35)

17. digit weeks ago i got cross faded and became unresponsive . i entered what we dubbed  the abyss  and it was the scariest place  feeling i have ever experienced . it was basically like the place in get out or like being in a dark closet where you can hear everything but cant move or speak .
   (ID: c374848a7cde05ee9d6d14f7ab991b3b11f71a87)

18. yep , i have had it in my eye , it sucked dick . most unpleasant thing i have ever had happen to me and i was circumcised as an adult !
   (ID: 93102e17c1a3f6136bb2fad08c587ad924185f76)

19. i still dreamed but it ' s like going from a old school box tv to the newest apple tv . you never knew you were dreaming in dinosaur until you don ' t dream like that anymore .
   (ID: c50abefedeeb0c19f834b1ebb28634054bccee26)

20. thank you for your words and your reply . it means a lot . i don ' t have any pain , but i think as of recently two weeks or so i probably lost some sensitivity . my ring finger lays against my middle finger just a tiny bit . at the same time , i also haven ' t been using my right hand  wrist to it ' s full ability so perhaps i haven ' t aggravated it as much as possible with what it ' s physically capable of . being scared isn ' t helping it though and i think is what caused the finger  touching . idk . it ' s kind of " tucked in there " , both my doctor and my surgeon told me i lucked out with it . i won ' t get it out myself and i ' ll follow up with my surgeon . i had a ct scan yesterday , i think i will call right now and inform them that whatever they see in the images is bothering me more and more and i don ' t think i can wait until march . sldkjsldkcx
