4. we never see the other people of the game world  they don ' t actually exist and are just artificial memories and illusions to the characters that are actually modeled . the game has an incredibly limited amount of locations , people , and things . she would have no future there except to continue living through the same experiences over and over . even besides that , we know that natsuki ' s home is not a comfortable or safe place for her . as for the matter of jobs and such , any of the dokies even monika would have the same problems with qualifications and paperwork . monika would be the least initially shocked at the transition , but i think any of them would end up being grateful to have been given the chance to make more of their lives than was allowed them within the confines of the game .

6. One of my favorite things is ellen.
   (ID: 630b45a8d3ef360a8a8a9626adbff80750d745a7)

7. the fact she mentions it was incorrect pretty much proved if this was real she heard the word wrong . so what ' s her point ?
   (ID: 5df8f31d7e0521d2306b8c923ad3cbb6e96e8d04)

8. i ' m assuming this is america . she ' s the kind of person i like to inform that the us has no official language . because we are the land of immigrants .
   (ID: 40e9f2306751118eda95174d093680e74831a34d)

9. i wasn ' t suggesting she get an elder scroll to do it . i was simply saying that there could be means of doing so that we aren ' t aware of , just like how the dragonborn is able to find a way to take down alduin and the other dragons .
   (ID: 9789fadf3a050c71c64ca7e31c4857fc9094d643)

10. digit the lady at the pizzeria said she would serve any customers who came into the shop but that she would not provide pizzas to a gay wedding . digit i seriously doubt the law would have covered her in this instance . no doubt she would have tried to use the law to cover her but i don ' t think it would have been upheld by any court . digit if she is really against gay weddings personally do you really think its right that she be forced to service a gay wedding or loose her business ? if you think its ok to force someone to do something they are morally against then i think there is something wrong with you personally . if you think its not ok for a person to make a living if they dont have the exact same values as you do , then again , i think that there is something wrong with you .
   (ID: 35eb47890f8874bbb988ec8308ba762f8377b3b8)

11. i would feel bad for them but also slightly jealous . then you have to realize that it doesn  t really matter that she couldn  t get number one because of course we don  t always get the love of our lives
   (ID: 465a8b7c9604514a10670d3813f18485575cfa5c)

12. when i saw her appear on the news i instantly thought " fucking useless " . i honestly don ' t have any animosity to her , barely knew she existed before all this , but now she ' ll always be " fucking useless " to me .
   (ID: 2c57168b7d6f49d0d294e3bae527d905f61675ba)

13. i know lol . she really is great . shes like a blessing in my life that came upon me when i was very confused and didn ' t know where to go . whenever i feel sad i listen to litterally any of her songs and feel better . i am not a robot has such a special place in my  . so does happy . especially becuase i have anxiety and depression so it makes it even better .
