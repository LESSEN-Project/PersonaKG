1. i feel like watching stuff like this is why i have such a hard time getting over being friendzoned . i ' m like " come on  let this be truman show or some scripted shit "
   (ID: 5f43a3019d69696064ac659bf6dd25b51f1e5bb6)

2. i don ' t believe that anybody feels the way i do , about you now .
   (ID: bfc2e9a6e5f84327293fa1a1fd0287066782bcec)

3. i think some people have mentioned that unless the sandbox is encouraged through narrative play , it won ' t occur even if the mechanics allow it . i like this idea , though , of sandboxing the game . here are some ideas off the top of my head   like orig dnd allow servants , slaves , and followers as rewards for quests , until your party is full of them  reward players with real estate  introduce a need for it and then create submechanics for things like smithing a sword , building a battering ram , or even modifying spells  introduce combinable elements . perhaps the magic shop doesn ' t sell potions , just ingredients . i hope these are helpful jumping off points !
   (ID: df28c2a39b633ca418192316a199668289382292)

4. cast away was probably the most egregious . they told everyone he got off the island , must have taken a lot of tension out of the raft scene .
   (ID: fc70415de2435c629ec792dbd90c954786c0bd16)

5. i think it ' s a nice app . new vocab is presented in a way that is easy to learn and backed up by flashcards , pictures and matching . this is the same way i learnt greek . the interface of the app honestly feels cluttered and out of place imho . it ' s a bit laggy as well . i think it would be nice if the app could be designed around the materiel design or a similar flat design . overall , it ' s a good app and i look forward to using it .
   (ID: 62dd5d4401c12ad4672526fa5c980c544020cf98)

6. that ' s the problem , i ' m a competitive person and i can ' t stand to losing . i can see my mistakes in replays so easily and when it comes to game i can ' t see them , i don ' t know it ' s because of tilt but something makes me go autopilot .
   (ID: c41e4affc406bbc71e6c12aabf095d759b6dbec2)

7. lol ! i liked it a lot , especially the sense of isolation and vulnerability you had playing as a regular soldier rather than a spartan . it also reminded me a bit of metroid prime , which is one of my all  time favorite games .
   (ID: 4ea608a8fbdec83863f8ba3f502bfd6966794702)

8. that ' s very true , i agree . but at the same time , i think " why don ' t give this life we ' ve got everything we have since it ' s not going to make a difference anyways , so why waste it ? "
   (ID: eca32d278abf2524af02edbb3cc3041ed8b0b880)

9. loot boxes and microtransactions . i ' d much rather pay for decent dlc , or even just a more expensive game up front , if it meant i didn ' t have to deal with all this monetization .
   (ID: 42817db6a2880fe4df5d65636e25385c67c89bb1)

10. well i don ' t see why not , it ' s never too late to start , if you ' re on xb1 i ' ll show you the basics of your character of choice
   (ID: 4b9dcbc3150f2c8587b40cc8f71a441739b7b272)

11. soul caliber iv . was going through beating it with every character . only had one person left to beat it with forgot her damn name but she uses the hoola hoop blade thing anyway i lost fight after fight after fight on the last boss and i totally raged . broke the disc , backhanded my stack of games across the room , kicked down a door . it was sad .
   (ID: 7ebdc00c75f6f836557e13d39a9efb279ed2ef7a)

12. duke 3d . i played that over and over so many times on pc .
   (ID: 79bdfdf686984c100c22b157137e9ff8181052bb)

13. i feel the exact same way ! i remember this fanfic i read in like digit and it was so cute and when i found it again i was like  what the fuck this is awful  i think it  s a combination of becoming older and being exposed to better content that makes you aware of how bad things actually were . maybe at the time we read our fan fictions the authors were the same age as us or younger so their writing was not so advanced , but now having grown older their writing has also developed but haha i  m glad i  m not the only one !
   (ID: 589a27cacaffb5126785db9f91c141a3cea2daae)

14. i just chose the movie i like . and i am not being racist . i dont find the race appeal for bploved it as a ' marvel ' movie as racism is not part of my upbringing . also , i am brown .
   (ID: 4f3fd3511e55513b94a4aa6c4ac9441a6ba9f86f)

15. the lyrics are literally " this one ' s a contradiction because of how happy it sounds , but the lyrics are so down " i don ' t think it counts , it ' s too obvious . some other twenty one pilots songs would probably fit better .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

16. that seems like a really bad trade for you man , i mean we still don  t even know what the codes give us right
   (ID: 350ebf5f22b005c6fa011b8241361bb7184ec8d5)

17. of course i agree with everything in the last part and yes demon stuff like that would be sick that  s how i thought demon of hatred should have been but that  s me . i never thought of a crane that  d be very cool same with the dragon .

18. you ' re suppsoed to release the ble  whatever before you push the plunger down . so tie off  register  release the belt . if you leave the belt on andyou inject more iquid int he vein then the vein is under more pressure . when you release it the blood flow continues and the drugs you inject is carried off with the blood that is pumping through the vein . or don ' t use one if you ' re able to do it withoout , it ' s not a necessary step just a helpful tool . the bruising could be a result of that if you didn ' t release it . what also helps if you bruise easily is to put pressure on the injection site . the alcohol wipe that you use to clean your arm with before iv you can also use to push down onthe site when you are pushing the needle out . this will stop the bleeding faster , so also less blood with leak from your vein causes bruising under your skin . but most important things are to use new needles , don ' t use the same spot too often and pick a different spot to iv so the previous places can heal a bit before you use them again . lave the site witht he trackmarks a lone for a bit , let it heal .
