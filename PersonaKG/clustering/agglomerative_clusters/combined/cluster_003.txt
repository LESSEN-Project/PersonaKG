Total from this dataset: 491

1. i agree with the fact local news dominates the subreddit . i also thank you for saying my opinion is well  worded good and bad aside , i just want one of the few subreddits i frequent to stay good  by " good " , i mean engaging in material , conversation and people . i genuinely don ' t mind the one or two puns that show up , but when it gets out of hand ? that ' s a different story .
   (ID: 9d1e879011bb23fa9a0cff4c99a536feb2705b86)

2. to be fair i kind of find it interesting . being a straight furry is like being gay in the world . we ' re made fun of , some people ignore us very small minority , but still , and its very difficult to find people you can relate to . so you won ' t find solice here . it ' s the world upside down and its sometimes fun to see what would the world be with lgbt being the majority . i know it can sometimes suck , but hey , being a furry is a choice unlike race or in some cases , arguably , your attraction . you have to put up with all the bullshit , but you can quit at any time .
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

3. what about reddit ' s down ? i figured it was mature enough to have lost it ' s down already .
   (ID: ab5c47b9d71750a64b0af468fe9d99ecea9868a9)

4. oooh snippy . look , most people aren  t going to run into entitled people like this but all the god damn posts complaining about the apparent fake posts or people claiming someone  s story is fake when it  s fairly reasonable is preeeeetty annoying .
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

5. you start by fucking posting on the right sub
   (ID: a443986595c715cd541cd3925619cb6f1e8ada83)

6. one of the dumbest , unfunniest posts i ' ve seen .
   (ID: 521b989779e5e44f8854ed1438b914dfb8f19eb6)

7. you ' re talking to a guy who like to browse porn and hentai subreddits your need to prove your philosophical superiority is misplaced .
   (ID: 0163212450bac6366408ac8e1e025d32048839ec)

8. well all you do is comment on this one subreddit so i ' m not surprised
   (ID: 2266fd8e27b1d50f2e144f7cd11716068cff21d5)

9. you aren ' t saying facts lmao just your opinions . sorry but you don ' t get to define what lesbian means .
   (ID: 183a5eea32f2c73a87c734920d3188862433e411)

10. what ? edit  ah i get it , let me fix that for you . " it ' s new . things change . you ' re not the first , or the last , one to do anything pretty much ever "
   (ID: ff51288ca8adbfbd763f8c0e670e39dfa27cb681)

11. i think people should learn to lose . i  ve lost many shipments to griefers yet i  ve never insulted them the problem with that is that most people can ' t handle such things happening to them so they get angry and or sad . not everyone is like you and can handle things like that . that ' s all i ' m saying .  but coming to this sub to post memes and bullshit about griefers and  tryhards  stereotyping them , really ? this is beyond childish . it isn ' t childish at all . look at the history of my posts on this sub , half of them are about tryhards and griefers . now you might be wondering why i posted those and why i think others post such memes . i have digit main reasons  to let out some steam after a shipment had been destroyed a way some people maybe take out thier anger to make a funny joke . not hating a griefer at the point of posting but rather to make others laugh . i ' m sure that ' s the most universal reason for posting griefer memes karma whoring . and i ain ' t denying that i sometimes did it as well so . any opinions on the said things .

12. no mans sky always were a good game . you suckers just say it is  was bad because the creator overhyped it and lied about some features . blame the creator . not . the . creation . thats not just about nms , its about every fucking thing  your wife died giving birth to your child ? blame yourself for making her pregnant or dont blame anyone thats just one example . and also the game became really good after those updates . fuck you . haters gonna hate .  digit
   (ID: de0709ad19c458ffff0b96aab8fcfa9c40b24603)

13. why don ' t you create it if you want it ?
   (ID: 08066be6331ea941a6f416b97fd2b6e9d4403a80)

14. yeah the whole politically correct culture is pissing me off . and i think it ' s really a small group of people claiming to be offended . seems like outrage is like a currency these days .
   (ID: 051a7508d568f725b1f0dc39e3253191d533920a)

15. so , this gets removed , but others such as the plane one and the dude staring into the fire whilst burning a fake slave neckchain is ok ? this promotes discussions about the show and is interesting and different .
   (ID: 0edec5419d401d3ddd7386c8d9356093f1fa13cd)

16. i don  t understand trolls . what is lacking or missing in life that they need the validation of words in a screen ? it  s pretty pathetic
   (ID: 467dbed573790a54a921a28f66e0e68f81106906)

17. i am trying to show you how i feel when you tell me to do something because of your " lord " i won ' t stop cursing until you give me a fucking reason other than a deity with a debatable existence said it isn ' t okay . why don ' t you try and help those over at atheism or at least get some questions answered by somebody smarter than me ? many people there are smarter than me .
   (ID: 1aa2a9bdfead7897363f32a7bc9e416ca9098b9f)

18. when my son posted about the time i helped him out after his " accident " jt was horrifying that ' s private
   (ID: bdbdc7c12fe37172b721ff3ae186b84ad646d582)

19. why did you delete your post ? why are you doing the exact same thing you just called the op out for ?
   (ID: a4eb94a9fe8ebabb780c319cc7d3f552eb79625e)

20. i get offended when it ' s not that way . like you want me to scroll all the way down this list ? when nobody from digit  of these countries will ever use this software ?
