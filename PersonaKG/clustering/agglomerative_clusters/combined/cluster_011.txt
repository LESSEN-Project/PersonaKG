Total from this dataset: 2169

1. artists do far more than criticize community norms . if anything , they emphasize the feelings that people share in those communities . the better question is , and the one i think you ' re trying to ask , is  is there a place  allocation of resources for dissent ? absolutely , it ' s democratic . artists see the world in a different way and i value that viewpoint . national endowment at the community level . i would fund that so hard . i ' d like to think that a majority of people would feel that way .

3. if god dosent like to see us suffer then why does he let us suffer ? i was raised in church but once i got older i realized it wasn  t for me . i know the whole it  s part of god  s plan story but what about starving children or kids being molested ? how could that ever be part of a god  s plan ? i mean no disrespect i  m just voicing my thoughts .
   (ID: 541b4cbc0fbf09faead4d7954b3a984391890627)

8. i can see why you  re getting downvoted but honestly , i had a similar fear . i just thought  oh shit , please don  t let this sub become one of those thinly veiled hate subreddits .  maybe reddit and the internet have made me too sensitive to this stuff but this is the first piece on this subreddit that i can  t enjoy and i don  t feel like it has a place here .
   (ID: d7b75c00237dc445cdc3ebc380fbcb79a40b1a5f)

9. upvotes dont validate my existence so do downvotes dont eliminate my opinion just to tell you once again , the person you call indogs has way way more stars than you i believe , you ' ll never even get to digit stars yet you call the person dog ? do u even know why he changed his flag to singapore ? so pathetic , throwing shits with no valid reason

   (ID: f4588f2a476206e602fe5b84647a1e777eaae604)

19. i ' m not sure how it is where you live but digit  digit people i meet on a daily basis are always rude assholes . like it could be small shit like not holding a door , not saying thanks after i bless a sneeze , shoving me out of the way on the bus just to get a better seat , purposely causing trouble with a waitress to get the manager involved  laughing at it . seeing this type of shit everyday really stacks up on my mind . i start wondering if it ' s worth being nice to people when most of others i see , really don ' t fucking care  perhaps my life would be way easier if i acted the way they did . but i do my best not to because it ' s the right thing to do . sometimes i meet that digit  digit who does things the way i would go about it , like helping a stranger lift their luggage on a train , running to catch a door for an elderly , helping a friend by giving them a ride someplace just to help out , etc . and those people remind me why being kind isn ' t a waste . since they can do it everyday , so can i . but you ' re welcome to think i ' m a narcissistic asshole for misinterpreting my comment . i ' m still going to try to help people anyway i can .
   (ID: cfabcbc785db80706dcc28a81eb7851d8c7bd3ce)

20. yeah . i dont get that . even as someone who likes trump , this is something i think is okay to make fun of . he even makes fun of his own typos like when he typed covfefe
