   (ID: 9284af9896fed617d56596c55fb3ff4e8a4c8dde)

2. then you really are as stupid as i suggested at the outset . they are completely accurate and they are about digit times more useful than your nonsense because they ' re the meat and potatoes and nobody gives a shit if you could add digit tomes of ands , ifs , or buts to them . " meat " is not a complete description of steak and " vegetables " is not a complete description of salad but those are the main points you think of when you see steak or salad on a menu and an adequate description of the difference between them for you to decide you feel like having one a lot more than the other . and all i asked you , was the difference between autism steak and retard salad .
   (ID: 3d776de779e565cac9f29e072415ad6b781eaca0)

   (ID: 0501bf1e5cd313190bb4590a1c677057b15a6e47)

5. many vets have conveyed such feelings . it ' s not a crazy thought .
   (ID: 7bad9dc0ff1a9ce0843818f35d9151cf701b4044)

6. it sounds like a very specific example . perhaps you already have an answer ?
   (ID: aeeeb72f8fa4535141823a3cf83acb5f60bbaff4)

7. because they love misaligned backs and broken phones
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

   (ID: 920ba0628cbea5588ecca4c8ba7f80b411ff70ef)

   (ID: 28e24cb71e2c0068fef35890d39022b686e4215d)

   (ID: db1ffea2a957f19bfc0fffdbd89a6d65be91fd5c)

14. i ' ve gone once to digit , they do it in front of the parliament building . it ' s so stupid . literally digit rows of hot dog carts and they all make bank . weed needs smoking and dressing like they asked a digit year old with mental problems dressed them . honestly its depressing how people act but they ' re all in their 20s pretty much so yeah i guess they are mentally handicapped
   (ID: 917dfa16e92ce1db67ec3f88bc07b87b70a36c95)

   (ID: 240d1415f521eebd4f0b74c693880dae8455a2e5)

20. it  s more like you return to home . i think it  s a pun on peter being a kid like spider man get back home ! or the chancla !
