8. " i ' m serious . there is a serious crack through the central weight  bearing support of the island . what is the repair protocol for that ? " i frown . i have been on this island since the beginning , digit . i was involved in designing these 3d printed plastic islands as rising oceans dominated needed living space . the recycled plastic designs are eco  friendly and include an airport as well as digit surrounding islands , which house digit , digit people . the island system was exactly what those of us on the coast needed . five minutes ago i was dreaming of retirement confident my home would last for digit years or more . this entry  level engineer , mark england , was risking his job by telling me , the lead engineer for the entire chain , that our home was close to falling apart . could i really have missed this ? " there is no repair protocol . the protocol in that situation would be evacuating everyone off the island and recycling the plastic . can you show me what you saw ? " he nods and we walk down two floors into the basement of the maintenance building . i unlock the door to the hull of the island . we step out into a wide expansive room . the flood lights click on from a motion sensor and we each grab a high  powered flashlight . we walk down steel steps to a charging dock for electric scooters and get on . he leads me for digit minutes into the expanse . i watch the grid numbers pass by and can imagine the streets above us . the island is beautiful . it has no heavy motor vehicles for safety and weight reasons , so the young use electric scooters and the elderly use electric wheelchairs . bicycles still haven ' t gone out of style . the size of the community makes it a bit of an idyllic small town , although there is flow to and from the other islands and the central airport . the harmonious city planning is enhanced further by the fact that you can see the ocean from nearly anywhere on the islands . we arrive at grid g7 , an important load bearing area with many more support columns than elsewhere on the island . mark shines his flashlight between two flood lights at the massive ridge that forms the spine of the structure . i see it immediately . there is a massive crack forming directly in the middle of the support . i know what lies above that crack . exactly in that position is the connecting road between this island and the central airport island . each island is connected to stabilize the structure in the ocean and even one being compromised could create a horrible chain reaction in bad weather . " thank you for showing me this . you can go . " " what ? " he raises his voice slightly , " what ' s going to happen ? should i evacuate ? " " no . don ' t raise any alarm yet . people need to be told through the right channels when a plan is in place . " he squints at me , frowning , then nods and drives away on the scooter . i pull out my cell phone and call mayor richardson . " jacobs ? what is it ? " he seemed annoyed to hear from me , understandable given the coming election . " there is a serious breach in the hull . potentially catastrophic . we may need to evacuate all islands . " " what ? you ' ve got to be kidding . you know i have an election coming up . it ' ll have to wait until after then . " i hear a click as he hangs up . richardson is completely self  serving , of course he would see this as a threat to his campaign . i call another number . the governor . " jacobs ! good to hear from you , son . " his loud voice makes me pull the phone away from my ear . " we need to have a drink sometime , boy ! " " sir , we should , but this is actually a serious professional call . we are having a problem on the islands . i think the island print had a flaw . all the structures may be compromised . " " now jacobs , have you been working too hard ? the island program has been a huge success . sounds like you need to retire already ! " his loud guffaw echoes in the phone . " you eggheads crunched those numbers a thousand times . i ' m sure it ' s fine ! is there anything else ? " " sir , i really dont  " " nonsense ! and i won ' t hear another word about it ! " he shouts . " i am connecting you to my secretary . she will schedule us a time for drinking whiskey and playing pool . relax . " jazz music takes over the line and i hang up . i flip through my phone to recent calls and i find the call from a unrecognized number , two hours ago . i call it . " mark ? " i say when he answers , " get ready and get off the island . i ' m telling everyone tomorrow . "

11. should have drank some of that booze before cold copping if you ' re scared about it . it ' s weird and awkward at first , it ' s a threshold you gotta push yourself over cause asking for drugs is not a normal conversation . once you ' re used to it you know exactly who and how to ask . find some hookers , taxi drivers , go to the needle exchange or find some other homeless guy . they will know , if everything else fails i even approach random people on the street . i always had dope in my hand in less than an hour of cold copping , in some cases in less than digit minutes .

   (ID: 28ecb35c880034ee5298d0c4abb71cabdafd1e4f)

20. cash almost none , like digit bucks or so , the clothing and guns , they are there , just not straight into the epilogue , by the end of part one you will be able to get them back in your saddle . not sure if all stranger ' s missions , but all the ones i had available before , are still there . legendary animals will be there as well as treasures and collectibles .   x200b  i only have one question and is if you figured a way so john is not so skinny ?
