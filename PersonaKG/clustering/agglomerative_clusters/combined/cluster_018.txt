1. i beg to differ . just because you ' re not overspending doesn ' t mean you don ' t need to keep track . and tracking expenses don ' t really take up much if your time . you probably need at most digit mins daily to do it .
   (ID: e7189ea885d9f7e9cdbd71ff2f2035f07ebaf6db)

2. if you have doubts , don ' t do it . i think you already know that .
   (ID: 7281ac55eb2a6383df4bfcf1408cda0145e29328)

3. yeah i understand ! it has a time and a place in my life i just made it an excessive habit and didnt treat it with the respect i should have i was a wake and bake every day into the night type of guy and i never admitted it was effecting me in an ill way because i was getting my work done and keeping things clean staying healthy but i neglected my mental state of mind living in an altered state of consciousness where i brushed everything off with a bowl just wasnt working for me anymore
   (ID: e3f34e146ce06ba2b5fc5a249c73494f93f56e86)

4. i hope she shocks the hell out of you and knows sign language im in college learning it and it is one of the best things ive ever done for myself . hearing aids ideally arent a big deal but im curious so i wonder , do you have photos of you wearing them ?
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

5. it ' s good self  control practice can ' t stay up drinking  the kids are waking up at digit am if you ' re lucky . i also find myself acquiring a lot of good habits because i want my kids to have them  my diet has dramatically improved since i reproduced , for instance .
   (ID: f3657f57aa348caf1c32ec21ef139ea41a45dc29)

6. i ' m not sure i see how that relates ? fat acceptance , in my understanding , is just accepting people for what they are and not judging them . there ' s no expectation at least no reasonable expectation that we should have to find fat women attractive . could you elaborate on what you mean ?
   (ID: f3f34b7b903c833de2625265da4585abdc86ab7c)

7. no , you ' re correct , obviously im generalizing it but to a skinny person , you ' re probably more likely to laugh off a joke about skinny you are versus people who are overweight would take a joke about their weight .
   (ID: 89e76efb1868896fe46bffbc2c10d965b53857d1)

8. go for it and get a pro ! just make a list of things you know for sure you don ' t like  want .
   (ID: 702ae3441c84a130e3b2867584502ce16fd5c09f)

9. glad it  s helpful  i  m fairly  new  as a catholic and not a cradle catholic either so i can empathize . there  s a really good video series from  dynamic catholic   they are currently doing this series during lent and i find it helpful  they  re 3ish minute daily snippets . it  s easier for me to listen to a video on my phone daily than most other things . certainly i don  t say the rosary enough . a couple days ago the video was about the  lie we tell ourselves   it hit me that i lie to myself too , sometimes , and you might as well . it really is more about saying yes to god everyday , even if we muck up and we do , and he knows this ! hope this link works . ? best wishes

10. i lost digit . digit stone  90lbs . then found 56lb of it again . am back on the losing it again . it ' s a war not a battle . don ' t give up if you start to slip . it didn ' t go on in a day and won ' t come off in a day . find your reason that motivates you and will help when what you want right now mmm . chocolate seems more important than what you want to achieve long term . but don ' t beat yourself up if you slip , you ' ve not failed . find like minded people for motivation . seek support from friends so they don ' t put temptation in your way . don ' t be surprised when resistance comes from the oddest places . people who ' re scared that you ' re changing or don ' t want to be the group ' s new ' fat one ' . just keep trying . you can do it .
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

11. if i had all that gym gear in my home , i most certainly would try that .
   (ID: e036cce09e42b447bacae037ef33243f155fd2bf)

12. oh so you were one of those " fit fats " i read about on the internet only . you dont think your cardio suffered or your joints , knees in particular wouldnt have been stressed less , or whatever sport you were playing you could have played better if you lost digit  pounds ? you are delusional to think it didnt stress your body at all no matter how young and " active " you were .
   (ID: 9462d83facbfbfe29873d9b93c7663411cb005ef)

13. i see . i feel people want others to exercise to conform to their standards using health and physique as a dumb excuse rather then caring about someone being happy . ofcourse it is different when someone is obese but you get the message . also , many sports are boring and gyms are full of toxic shits anyway .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

14. as a child , i suffered a lot from ear infections and as a result i had these drainage tubes which meant that water at the time was a big no . even though that ' s a thing of the past now , my ears are still quite sensitive when it comes to pressure and i would very much like to avoid experiencing what the girl from your scuba class had to go through . i guess i ' ll have to stick to snorkeling .
   (ID: 5fe12b36dc6d3370836c6683997c005efb656c99)

15. i dont get the relation of your question with your text . are you asking that practising to get digit headshots per day is too much ? well if you rly have the time to get 1000headshots sure why not . as states in other posts hs only isnt rly the best way to practise .
   (ID: 03ab57cad5a50b5d67ff5f6e1ee7e9c2a2a602aa)

16. i was told they were rubbish but  digit  fall damage and digit  poison resist but i could be wrong , i haven  t played in a while
   (ID: 51417b57f4b2dc72dd07ac6a8ebfc978fa9d0661)

17. take care when you do this .
   (ID: e6c4a2b8e8c999b54ade342babc3d7b48868cc6d)

18. so far only one of them caused problems . had that one removed around digit , but the rest have been fine so i figure i ' ll just leave em there .
   (ID: 7921460db376d8f318b71729dcd4931f12a1d0c9)

19. i don ' t know enough about canada to know if this is stupid or not , so feel free to ignore me if it is . can you sign up with credit karma ? it ' s a free site that will show you your credit reports and they also will show you offers you might qualify for . check it out and see if they recommend any particular cards . discover cards are usually pretty easy to get , as are capital one cards . just be careful of things like annual fees and high interest rates .
   (ID: 0e19a35c711a9c78f764d5268c09b16559cdadbf)

20. yeah that ' s exactly what i ' ve been doing , i ' ll work on the getting the revs lower
