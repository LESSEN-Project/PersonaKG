1. honestly the best thing for you to do is to tell your boyfriend straight up the entire situation . i don  t think the relationship will last sadly after that because he is straight and he can  t force himself to be attracted to you afterwards , but for your own personal happiness and mental health you need it tell him and transition . but who knows he might still retain attraction to you afterwards , it is a possibility . i know how bad dysphoria can be , my partner is trans and i  ve been with them before and after their transition and they  re much happier now than they were before . i hope you too can remain friends since all that would happen is that he loses attraction . best of luck to you , be brave and you can make it through . i hope all goes well red  heart

2. holy shit , fuck off . you ' ve been at this for weeks now . give it up . you became a fucking piece of shit deadbeat excuse for a father , got addicted to drugs and never paid child support . why the fuck do you think the judge won ' t let you see the kids ? because you ' re a fucking failure of a human being . they don ' t need you in their life . please leave me alone and never contact me again .
   (ID: ac16118040bd30364df28924a08320a2668f71ae)

3. why would i want to talk about when i buried my shit as deep as i could ? oh wait that ' s not what you meant .
   (ID: 0577b566bc01c7d79464f522c720317d81923a8c)

4. the danger it presents yeah , the danger it presents in your mind . you don ' t happen to be related to jack thompson do you ? literally the same exact arguments as all those retards who said the show digit and pregnant romanticizes teen pregnancy . then looking back history proves that the show literally did the opposite , it lowers the rate of teen pregnancy
   (ID: 737313878d4c0ea930e14b4d6569b91c8028c768)

5. you ' re welcome . you know what you need to do . i ' m sorry , i know it sucks , but you can ' t change people . in the long run you will feel better without him . happy birthday !
   (ID: 82227bc3f73e4753802bc6bc025e3544c0c76857)

6. you ' re right . thank you so much . i usually never talk about my private stuff but i feel like this has to get out of my way . sorry to hear about your boyfriend , is he going to be okay ?
   (ID: 617a45b75601128e5c804bd8ca6b8e525a4aa02d)

7. i ' ve done this many times . i ' ve done it for many different reasons , including proving that i could . throughout my life i have learned that there are an infinate number of roads a person can go down and they all lead to the same place . some of those roads will make your life miserable while some will be rewarding in every imaginable way . how can anyone know if they are on a road that ' s rewarding ? the only way to answer that is to ask yourself if it is worth it . whenever i asked myself that and found a negative answer , i turned away from that road and took a different one . in person i don ' t often share personal stories . people have told me that i am an unknown variable or an enigma or whatever . but in many aspects of my life i have no personal history from the perspective of others . the only reason i share my stories here is because i enjoy writing and maybe one day someone would be interested in reading my stories . people often get to know me and associate with me regularly and still don ' t know anything about my past . these people end up surprised when i cut them out of my life for no reason at all . i don ' t intend to do it to them , instead i am doing something for me . i cut people out of my life because i am changing my life and have decided that parts of my old life don ' t have any place in my new life . people who know me well are never too surprised when they don ' t hear anything from me for months or even years . with these people its no surprise if i randomly show up without any warning after a few years . if i act like its only been a few days since the last time i spoke to them its not anything new . i don ' t make a big deal about saying farewells . if a close friend is leaving for a few years i normally don ' t treat our goodbye ' s as anything special . whether i will see a person again in a few days or a few years doesn ' t really make any difference to me .
   (ID: fed0c0c8b0ae958dd1a6a750f7a4f677f0b34628)

8. how do we get a hold of your friend
   (ID: b4d61ff0c23f7ce5512ee9f64d1bea0f938f262a)

9. we did , we were basically brothers . it is so strange because its been digit months and now i feel as if he never really existed . i have all these memories , but i just can ' t describe how it feels . when i see pictures , it is almost as if he only existed in those pictures and not in real life . i know that sounds like i didn ' t care about him , but his death took a piece of me . it is just a weird feeling .
   (ID: c374848a7cde05ee9d6d14f7ab991b3b11f71a87)

10. it sounded like that yes , very loud and terrifying . glad to know it wasnt a woman or man being murdered
   (ID: 0cd386c702105bbc1d5ff54477982a219c3af52c)

11. if i found you in real life , i would get an ar  digit rifle and shoot your fucking brains out , you ' re probably sarcastically saying that you ' re scared . you should be scared because right after that , i am going to cut your limbs off and feed them to the cannibals , and i am going to sice open your stomach and put a grenade in there til your whole body explodes . i am going to burn the remains of your body and bury them in a secluded area so nobody finds out what happened to you . they ' ll just think you disappeared . you should be lucky i don ' t know who you are in real life , cause if i did . i would find out what city you live in and where your house is . you think you can get away with harassing me over the internet ? control your actions and what you ' re gonna say before you do so , smartass . use your fucking brain next time .
   (ID: ac16118040bd30364df28924a08320a2668f71ae)

12. if you have genuine evidence , like . it ' s not what you know , it ' s what you can prove in court " then i ' d say open fire and expose him . what would you want to wait for ?
   (ID: 3191fce935a433eb5bf640dcdf40d71c47c3a93a)

13. actually what your describing is a thing that has nothing to do with anger . " call of the void " is when you see an opportunity to do something you know to be horrible and feel a sudden urge to do it . this happens to let your mind know it has control over the situation . like standing on the edge of a cliff . the mind goes " this is scary , i could fall , i could die " so the next step is " i could kill myself , but i won ' t kill myself , so i ' m not going to die . does that make sense ? tl  dr you ' re fine , everybody feels this , it ' s a way to feel in control .
   (ID: d54a04c3eba52404f5dd7abb0e459a949dbc7f93)

14. see , it is weird for me because i know it is good for me and that he was emotionally vindictive but some parts of me just miss components of our friendship that only we had and none of my other friends have shared since . it only makes me more upset because i think he genuinely did treat me poorly and i hate how he always convinced me that it was my fault i felt that way . it was just some shit . it also took a pretty serious fight to separate us , but a part of me is still wishing i could fix that and be friends . maybe that says something about how i perceive myself or my friend group ? i dunno . i could go on but . comment section lel

15. woah this hit home . i was in a very similar situation for digit  digit years with two friends who put me through the same shit you were put through . and i understand why you are scared because so am i . the thought of them makes my blood boil . do you live in another city to him or ?
   (ID: e46baea29cbc117a037f63fbc38055b7e034a038)

16. sure it ' s avoidable . kids can be very reasonable if you know what you ' re doing and address the problem correctly . let ' s say your young child does something wrong , and you spank them . do you think they really understand what they did wrong  why it was wrong , or are they suddenly behaving because they ' re afraid of being spanked again ? fear based discipline like that can often create kids that are better at hiding their bad behavior around authority .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

17. it ' s gonna weight on you for a longtime . the best thing to do might be just to think about it long and hard until you can accept several things  you and that person aren ' t and won ' t be in a relationship again , probably that you still like them as in don ' t dent it , and that it was your fault . you also need to make sure that you ' ve changed . if it was your personality , then you need to make sure you are less like what you were i . e . less judgemental . if it was something you did , you need to promise yourself you won ' t do it again and remember the consequences and pain it brought from doing it the first time .
   (ID: 125ddbf9c8c84552065bdd657a82dd3f392bf5c1)

18. i read , " however , she does seem to assume i don  t know what i am doing at all "  if my daughter was digit with a baby i would assume the same . being a parent is a major responsibility , i currently have digit . i ' m in college as well , and i ' m almost twice your age . college is literally the only thing i have the energy for outside of motherhood , i can ' t imagine what you would want to go out and do that your mother is like , " no , no , no " to .   x200b  as far as getting your mom to give you more freedom , she ' s probably afraid you ' re going to go out and get pregnant again  it ' s a very valid fear . she questions your judgement , your ability to be responsible . what she has to go on is you getting pregnant at digit . your first decision as an adult was to become a parent , it sounds like she ' s afraid you will continue to make decisions that have her questioning whether or not you are capable to live an adult life where you can make rational decisions for yourself .
   (ID: 4a699f45d7c076d67a8d89f2c711ff27f50199fb)

19. i wish i didn  t find your account , your post history is fucking mental . it  s literally like some true detective serial killer shit . you need to get out before its too late .
   (ID: c06f82a9d6f502a9c5707645e6b0bc869ff37975)

20. more importantly , what do i think of myself for getting into someone ' s personal life like that .
