6. i laid mine out in chunks like front left  front right , back bottom , back left  right , shoulders , etc . basically , as icreamboy said , plan ahead . also , with the enthusiasm of buying patches , you may end up with some patches from bands you enjoy . then realize you don ' t enjoy them enough to have them stitched to your back . so think about the patch before you put it on , and if it ' s something you will feel comfortable with for a while . sure , you could remove it later , but as said before planning makes a visual difference . i have maybe digit patches that i bought specifically for my vest that , upon laying them all out , i decided against using for one reason or another .

10. digit tip , be the " i ' m down " guy . overtime , a few minutes after quitting time , travel . those little extras make you stand out and they will give the overtime , most importantly keep you working . i know you were asking in terms of outside of work but this is the advice i give apprentices that always ask how they can get head or how they can make more money , but it all comes down to the same thing , if you keep working you keep getting paid .
   (ID: a3982a84363698446960e86a440ed3314f4325a3)

16. i sub at many local to me ones , it  s very challenging but rewarding . it is a tough situation because many of them are all over the spectrum , as far as reading level , basic math skills , etc . and of course most of my time is spent modifying behavior and teaching proper behavior . but there  s moments where we learn something together , or they are all participating in a discussion , where i am really happy . but it  s tough , i definitely couldn  t be a teacher there or do it for digit years , like some of them . but it is great experience .
   (ID: e8fea87ced4a86b7ba9c50ae33cf5b3dda99af88)

19. hey all , so i ' m currently a 1st year physics student in one of the better uk unis and am starting to fear for my future . the thing is i only have enough money to sustain myself for the duration of the course , that means that i will only have the opportunity to do one internship because of how the uk system works , no masters studies , no digit year industry placements . so after digit years i will have a bsc in physics and will be looking for a job . i ' ve tried reading up online what a physics graduate can do , however most of the conversations are geared towards masters and phd ' s and for undergrads they usually talk about majors  minors in the us , which isn ' t a thing here , i only have physics to my name . now , i don ' t care that much if my job has little or nothing to do with my course , as long as it doesn ' t feel like my education was a complete waste of time . though it seems to me like i can ' t get into nucleaoptics  medical  meteorological physics , because they have enough masters and phd applicants . i like programming , but i won ' t be qualified enough to compete against compsci  engineering graduates , even if i take extra modules in them .   x200b  so besides teaching which i really don ' t want to do , am i completely screwed ? i only have one chance at an internship , what sector should i aim for that has no problems accepting physics bsc ' s with a little bit of experience ?
   (ID: 96167969642339382f3b9c4eeee4ea73aec3823c)

20. no , you can only make money by getting the people with money to give it to you . a service is useful , and i don ' t care how many new jersey housewives you poll , a dog fingernail painter does not do anything useful . you can only create wealth by performing labor .
