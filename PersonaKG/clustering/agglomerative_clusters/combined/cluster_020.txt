1. late to the party but let me explain the real reason they are almost extinct  remember in oregon trail when you went hunting and shot everything and was like fuck yeah a 900lbs of food . my family has been at a grueling pace , and one of the kids has dysentery  we could really use this . then you realize  you can only carry 100lbs . that is the story of the american buffalo .
   (ID: 109fa004cbb85f6a703624f8b4393d7d7d685509)

2. chanel west coast for her terribly adorable laugh
   (ID: 8a914d1b332f7e39fd1f0cbb2c4b483e19f43fd7)

3. i ' m a small child again , like digit or digit , i ' m just doing my shit playing in the back yard , then out of fucking nowhere three dinosaurs are resurrected . but not just any dinos , the three from fucking power rangers dino thunder . they start eating shit and obviously since i ' m a small child in this dream i ' m powerless to stop them , and children can ' t run very fast what the fuck am i going to do if one decides to eat me . and obviously power rangers aren ' t real so none of them every show up . so here i am trying to find some place to hide from these rampaging dinos when suddenly one spots me usually the pteranodon and the last fucking thing i see before i wake up is that fucker staring at me like a hungry bird .
   (ID: d786fcd0afbed17f795e41e12bf7c85d045d2a0f)

4. the fear of spiders is not something humans are born with , it is something you learn . if your parents always start screaming and crying when they see spiders , you ' ll learn to think spiders are scary . dogs also don ' t have an instinctual fear of spiders , so they would have to be taught to fear them too . most dogs aren ' t afraid of spiders , so they don ' t have a born fear of them either . but i ' ve seen dogs that are afraid of spiders , and their owners are always afraid of them too , so it seems they can learn it too .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

5. for me the only thing that worked was a motion sensor sprayer connected to the hose . gave the cats a hefty drench but didn ' t hurt them , and meant my kids weren ' t stepping in vile cat poop . the moggies soon learned to stay away .
   (ID: a99ac82078cfd11980b48ae3d5fc8cabf3c69484)

6. i wouldn ' t have a clue so thanks ! i just hate bugs of any sort but took this picture to show my kids husband couldn see what i was talking about .
   (ID: 063ff05b3364c41fa72065634c0e90854c7272a4)

7. if my son got one of those he wouldn ' t want to eat it   he ' d want to preserve it in its cute state .
   (ID: 6fa65e005cc7ba05dc62c263af1ea289902ce6d1)

15. yeah , i suppose may as a middle name is nice . thinking about it more , i wouldn  t wish the whole cutesy name thing on my child either . i hated it growing up , and even now . thank you for the response
   (ID: 4b09daa44fc74718837e867df140c059b7377dd4)

16. i  m a nanny and honestly you pay for what you get . if you want someone to take care of your kids with love and care then you need to pay them happily . the family i nanny right now don  t need me for many hours but they don  t want to lose me so they still pay me my normal pay . if you want someone who you will trust and will take good care of your kids , you pay a considerable amount .
   (ID: 7d48334cb8c79d90b96048b0f085563eb847ba89)

17. i so want to adopt and i plan to in a few years . i  m only digit but feel i have a blessed life for my age and i want to share this with a child that hasn  t had a great start to life . nothing brings me more happiness than knowing i  ve helped turn a child  s life around for the good
   (ID: 0b40e1731a58e377af57361e27d4264ac065a5b8)

18. did you know peta has kill shelters ? i mean , a gun owner would never kill a harmless beretta . would they ?
   (ID: a23935a11b1de288af939de6809066afab50fe71)

19. lola deserves a sibling . i like this one too , the small realistic scratch on the babies face make it .
   (ID: 48a88dc7eb2bacff2435dad342a33464452811ab)

20. this sounds like a lack of training  impulse control issue and not the dog actually hating you . your friend should train her , it ' s not cute when an adult pitbull acts like that and is dangerous for the dog ! there ' s a guy in my area who brings his totally untrained   digit lb pitbull to dog parks . the dog regularly jumps on people and bites their hands  pulls on their clothes . the people involved have all been dog owners so they know to remain calm , but i don ' t see it going well if a dog  fearing stranger or child were the target .
