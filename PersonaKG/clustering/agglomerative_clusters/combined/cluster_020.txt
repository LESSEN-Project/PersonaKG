1. no , it ' s a small private college . i ' m not going to give any more details though just because i don ' t like posting my location on the internet .

   (ID: a04ffec23ab9c2af8d4ac433e06db2b5d1b4bf9b)

5. i love bars ands skiing . i worked at and managed a fairly successful bar for seven years and have also lived in colorado . let me rant  coat hooks . everywhere , but especially under the bar top . the bar must have a bar for your feet . while being in touch with the local brewery is rad , if you are not trying to alienate anyone have one canned macrobrew option . i love beer but after a few craft brews i just want an ice cold bud . it ' s ok to have a small menu but make sure you do what you do well . make sure the menu does not alienates non  drinkers . which is to say if its boring , generic , or if there are good vegetarian options . what ' s the outside space look like ? could you park a food truck tacos ! outside to better maximize indoor space . on space  maybe run a standing level bar around the perimeter for people to congregate and have a place to rest drinks . jukebox . not all the time but if people want to guide the energy of the environment , let them feel comfortable . mountain bars mandate a good bloody mary as well as a good margarita . don ' t fuck those up . do not make it " no ski boots " on bathrooms  i always like the urinals that go all the way to the floor because i get to pee on the floor . however when i am layered up from the cold , doing the business in a union suit gets weird and my aim isn ' t the same . these are just some of my initial thoughts . i have a wealth of ideas and even more opinions . i have dined out for almost every meal for the last decade . i enjoy dining and drinking more than anything  it is my favorite hobby . i love both the dives and the fine dining . be one thing and do it well versus trying to juggle things and not really have an image or vibe or feeling or whatever the fuck you wanna call it when people think of your joint and are like yeah that ' s the spot . good luck i want to open my own place someday .

8. the best suggestion i ' ve heard on the subject is , ask your pizza delivery guy . start with cheap chain places like dominos , because their drivers are more likely to not give a fuck . a driver for some local shop might be the son of the owner or something . so you order a small pizza in case you have to try this more than once in a night , and tell the pizza dude your situation . you are new to the area , and could use help finding bud .
