1. chinas navy is absolute dogshit and they know it , if they were to go to war with nato their naval imports would stop because of naval blockades , which would cripple their economy . also , china simply cannot produce enough food to feed digit , digit billion , which means another famine would start if their naval imports were to get cut off . as you already said , china has wayyy too much to lose and honestly not much to gain from a world war .
   (ID: fdefb1d7a8df147e0b4b08e717b4c6db2b3a28f1)

2. you have flaired this post as serious , please keep in mind that most of religion is complete bullocks .
   (ID: b5bfc53fa7245451bad229f942e351fdc7360321)

3. a lot of my extended family believe gay people are going to hell even though i ' m pretty sure one of them is gay . but yeah , i don ' t believe that .
   (ID: b779c0f28aaed5c7cbc5476e91a7eb397a6933bb)

4. it ' s not rude at all ! i do enjoy talking to folks with different thoughts and opinions on the world , as long as its a respectable conversation . i ' ve always believed that god lets us have our free will . i mean , what a life we would have if we where micro  controlled by a guy we didn ' t really know . i also think that bad things happen , because we don ' t live in a perfect world , and while i don ' t know what a perfect world would be really , i could say that it would be no harm to anyone . the world we live in is thanks to the fall , and is a consequence of that decision  thanks , eve !  unfortunately . humans , in my opinion , also need to have something to look up to , something greater than themselves , whether that be science , a public figure , a deity , or even an object .
   (ID: 13429813198f2aaef97e18644aa776da323f48a1)

5. how can you seriously say that ? it was pretty much men who fought on the frontlines in both world wars , and almost every war after , you are being completely disrespectful towards the people who risked and gave their lives just so you could live comfortably and be able to write this comment . get a life and show some respect for the people who , i dare say , saved the world . and about the raping and murder , can you give me a study or report about it ?
   (ID: 93c3b3d523de0afd404d3bcb4acdf023866f9281)

6. another good strategy is to have foreknowledge of whether or not they say " shoot " at the end of the phrase , and then do the opposite of what they do to disrupt the round to give them more time to think , and generally they ' ll not choose rock since they had to think for a longer period of time , and will digit  of the time choose scissor , allowing you to choose rock and beat them .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

7. jesus worries about other people and died horrifically to save them . what are we doing ? why should we be comfortable ?
   (ID: 2a3f07a52e2fc5e79fd2ed52f4f601fa39ebe2e4)

8. if someone is gonna drink and drive , they  ll do it whether it  s in the daytime or the night time . same goes for all the other things in that long ass post of yours . as for the weather . yeah that changes during the day too . there  s poor visibility during the day and night sometimes . i  m not replying to you again , you  re clearly looking for an argument . maybe if you stuck to the topic , you wouldn  t have gotten your knickers in a twist !
   (ID: 5f75c9b696f1ea78d1a7d21e5a6d5dd1c9391b14)

9. couldn  t care less about the environment like everyone else here does . i want jet packs and virtual reality social media
   (ID: ad24fe51d61dbe3cddd863ba9cb6adae61265a06)

10. sadly that  s a reality of all conflicts , violence does not discriminate however beyond that i don  t know enough about that specific situation to have an opinion .
   (ID: 8cdbf7ed2ace2eeed8bd2b0e2e86001342f83a1f)

11. you know , we non  americans give you guys in the us a lot of shit , sometimes rightfully so but really , that first amendment of yours is fucken poetry . is it idealistic ? hell yeah . do i want all of humanity to live under governments that take it ' s ideals as the norm ? hella yeah . for all the shitty stuff that shitty people do around the world , that is one piece of writing that really says something .
   (ID: b7464d681f64ad88cda3f6014fd0dd3a8bebed33)

12. if they understand everything else i said , then they understand the last part too , they ' re just in denial .
   (ID: f4f3116c36134aaf6c836035cf76dc86210b1c12)

13. well they ' re not . it ' s not like they kill or anything . terrorists and mental health issues kill , and i guarantee that any mass shooting would have the same number of fatalities , if not more , if it was carried out with a knife . gotta protect our guns above all else ! serious question  on this sub , surely we assume everything ends with  s by default right ?
   (ID: 2ac4d2cea574e655d7fdb1ab9b4886989929ca96)

14. it ' s hilarious to see americans take guesses , like the rest of the world didn ' t fucking exist lol just look at what happens where it already is legal , dummies .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

15. why are you asking this ? like other people said there ' s nothing wrong with it , they don ' t hurt anyone for me as long as they don ' t convince others to be gay i ' m ok with it , they ' re humans just like you and me
   (ID: 2a3d0cc7409627207d71d58affd421983020efbe)

16. science doesn ' t have to give any explanation , but it could point out the reasons why someone is ' messed up socially ' which would be the first good step towards change . better than the typical religious explanation which is something like ' you need jesus in your life ! that ' s why you are messed up ! let ' s pray together ! ' and ' purpose ' in life ? that ' s easy . it ' s whatever you decide it is . sure , it might be hard deciding , but in the end it is still your choice to make .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

17. for the international muppets it ' s 4am in italy . for an article and tweet from different sources to be taken down or edited right now is just weird . i mean i can see night editor having access to the article but the twitter as well ? do journos share their twitter access ? i wouldn ' t . i don ' t have twitter so not digit  sure how it works
   (ID: 5ea29f01c8cdade4f178fd446d00647edc5fc70e)

18. if a rubber ball filled with helium is placed on the incline , it will not roll . if a ball of glue is placed on the incline , it will not roll . almost nothing ever has a single cause . most things have their entire light as their cause , and it ' s usually nonsensical to consider something to be a one true cause of an event . this is the first flaw i see in your definition of " cause . another flaw i see is  nowhere in the naive definition does it say everything must have a cause . yet your argument hinges on this .
   (ID: fae28587bce17296589bf92d656ad68ee32601d6)

19. no you want to know why you don  t deserve to be here if you don  t come legally and you won  t leave willingly just like if someone enters my house they forfeit their right to live
   (ID: a778c9b10000a3e15377e87997ef5bea46cfe33f)

20. well you were correct which does say something . i will say that i would hope more minorities would agree with what i ' m saying , those who have experienced the worst of discrimination are usually the most motivated to end it .
