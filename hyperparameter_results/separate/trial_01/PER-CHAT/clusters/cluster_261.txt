14. i find this is very sexist , not all men are that way , just as not all women are . assuming someone ' s behaviour based off or sex or race is a terrible thing to do .
   (ID: a4ca6f6d5423082303099ff40ea214abf6e933a6)

15. agreed , and well said . but i feel the pee  pee tape would just be dismissed by those who worship his cult of personality . so why would trump actually care if they have dirt on him ?
   (ID: 15a1e0e5255acd3f4a9e5090c310ec9fad9aae19)

20. you need to talk to a therapist or counselor , you need help navigating and learning to deal with the emotional torture you  ve been put through . the fact that you  ve recognized that your behavior is wrong is a wonderful and big first step , now you just need to learn some tools that will help you accept and move on from this .
