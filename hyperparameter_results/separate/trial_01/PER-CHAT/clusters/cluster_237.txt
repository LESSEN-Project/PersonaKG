1. another good one is when you get strangled for whatever reason , just scream daddy at the top of your voice and then you ' re cool to go
   (ID: 686eff104239aaffdb8b70404f13746e85ed4255)

2. just tell them  we are thinking about moving states because       and if your reasons are good enough , they might now say anything .

3. honestly this is so tough because there ' s so much good children ' s literature   x200b  maybe diary of a wimpy kid ? i read the first book and it just didn ' t appeal to me
   (ID: fa12f266139006dfab9b74298d80e5133e7731db)

4. no problem . another thing i never mentioned is that there ' s really not much information on what psychstudio is . if i hadn ' t read your description on reddit , and just went on what was on your landing page , i wouldn ' t have any idea what i was looking at . if you need inspiration , dropbox ' s landing is a good example of how you could add some information to your landing page .

5. i have all of my texts backed up to the cloud along with all of my photos and videos , so when i  m missing this particular person , i just go back and re read texts , revisit all of the old photos and videos and remember the good times we had .
   (ID: 84b8bb5f42335570289ddc1a44384ba027d1b4fd)

6. life must be good for you , not talking shit in anyway . just saying appreciate it
   (ID: 882504fd18f4b9c4e5c3e7cc63572027f0f40f4e)

7. their eyes . you can see whether or not someone is good or bad just by making eye contact , or at least i can .
   (ID: 1d39daed654c59dbe2076d0171bf5d18da510d72)

8. my good friend brought this guy home we were roommates and at first i hated his damn guts because i had been wanting to get with her . we tried to fight each other at least a dozen times a day , but one day , nobody knows how or why or what happened but we just instantly became best friends .
   (ID: aaaecf7e1ff261f2a41ad2f7d0229a3f043cb546)

9. that some fat guy gave toys to kids around the world just for us being good .
   (ID: a0c4891e4410f2abc264c6eba1aa9a68050db9da)

10. same thing happens at coffee shops . everyone is loading up on diuretics  eventually everyone has to go . and the guy next to you is just as good as any to watch your stuff while you speedpiss .
   (ID: 639e1719702736f7b69fb413882dedbcc22d5cc2)

11. yes americans is damn good . check out powerhawk , subverse or just their albums if you haven ' t already .
   (ID: 10594edabefcf007dabe80a5bc00f7fb92ac7501)

12. the other option is to look up barnacle sites , and find one that you can go and harvest your own meta alloys from . biggest benefit is that they sell for good money when you bring them back to the bubble , and you can usually get more than a few from one site . just remember to bring along your srv !
   (ID: de35ad51dc200da1452964b58c442367fc50d0d5)

13. " how do i look . " good  bad . " just tell the truth  how dare u "
   (ID: ab7a7f7aaeeb2a36ccc6b5797875ccd94c9233c7)

14. normal is what we call it after understanding the deviant state exists , but we aren ' t aware of that state until it ' s deviated . until then , normal working order , or good , is the only state of the system . we ' re just arguing semantics at this point , so have a nice day
   (ID: 001fb70a2bc87afad26bd12110ca80f5bb4e6373)

15. i can guarantee they do not . but looking at your other comments , i can tell you  re just a sad little man who loves calling women whores . good luck in life with that attitude !
   (ID: be25689b94c143a66dbdf8d935f1a2a00d939140)

16. they were trying to get rid of child porn on their site , but doing a blind generic sweep of just nsfw content with a weak bot didn  t do them any good . porn bits are still around , countless nsfw blogs , and i  m sure there are still pedos lurking on that site . i heard if they had been deleted off tumblr that they migrated to twitter
   (ID: 44eba9a0cf089ec615a77db5d42a2c01b63cb259)

17. i really can cook . my husband is just so good at it that i tend to have ' accidents ' when its my turn .
   (ID: bfbfd4c4caa6b137f79275a24c99808ba3d2305b)

18. what i basically mean is that i have a sim card but the mobile data is too expensive . is there perhaps some way to get mobile data roaming ? for cheap or just any good alternatives ? i ' m willing to pay for a service that works
   (ID: 4a904b3db5017f5069f27886874bdeee777d5c06)

19. controller has to be in good condition . and make sure your ps4 has the serial number sticker on the console because they didn  t check my console for the sn before they factory restore my ps4 then told me they can  t accept my trade because of the missing number . so just heads up
   (ID: 811d4b0550a32bc0c913ee8c14c24c8f691907cf)

20. cincinnati , columbus , akron , toledo , dayton all went for hillary . there ' s just too many rural parts of ohio . at least the corn is good and the milk is fresh ?
