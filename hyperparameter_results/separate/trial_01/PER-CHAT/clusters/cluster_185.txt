1. i ' m a really quiet , shy , kind person to the people who have classes with me . i think they see me as a sweet girl . i have a big urge to one day , for no apparent reason , slam my book shut , knock over my desk , and storm out of the room . i would just love to see the look on their faces .

2. a great performance by the team and not just specific player which is something we have to continue to do . rashford showed today why he will be a scary , scary player when he gets into his 20s . i think people forget just how young he is but today is when we saw that he is going to be one of our best academy players ever .

3. i ' m one of the people that thinks the sparky doesn ' t need a buff . when it does work , damn . i just think people are using it wrong . i always see the sparky coming down the lane with a push . never a counter push . and that ' s where the spark shines . when played on your side of the map as a counter push , it ' s devastating .

4. right , you just described what " rare " or " uncommon " goals are , not iconic . when people think of that barca ' s ucl run , they remember messi ' s goal . that ' s why it ' s iconic .

5. i was told by a wise old man  you either love yourself or you  re afraid of who you are  what you are becoming . also , people dealing with depression have a tendency to think that tomorrow will be worse than today just because of the way they currently feel . since then , i started thinking about my feelings from a different perspective

6. i think you are an upstanding member of a higher functioning society . i agree with you on all points . and i greatly appreciate that you have replied to people disagreeing with you . it ' s just a shame that none seems open minded to it .

7. constitutional free speech is generally meant to ensure that the government can  t drag you away for criticizing it . people have come to think it means they are immune to repercussions from anyone at all , for what they say . that  s just flat  out wrong .

9. it hasnt . if anything , i just have to put up with the dumb jokes .  i bet you can sing haha !  also crazy people who think i can somehow secure them a meeting with their celebrity idol .
   (ID: d645e3566baedb2a71bfc2d093b2364e4cf9301a)

10. sorry shankar , as i said , i think people should keep their word . i believe you should just complete the bet , she was being nice offering you a potential way out

11. true that . but still its stealing all the animations . and i donr think anyone who watches these will care about oversimplifies and even tho he gives credit it wont matter if people doesnt check it . and its still a problem if oversimplified is not aware of this . also i have a general anger to these kind of stuff . many if not all turkish youtube channels just steal content and ideas .
   (ID: f8371dedd8c4c7fcaded068c8434dceaabae68a7)

12. nah , i think it ' s just a typical case of miscommunication and it can happen . nothing to get mad over on either side but people are grumpy early in the morning so no need to blame anyone for that
   (ID: 608947aa148c9da18403f15775e7f178792f7d39)

13. the asylum laws are already lax . the real question is just how many immigrants would come to the us if we truly had an open border policy . the tens of millions of people looking for work would continue to suppress wages . who do you think would feel it most ?
   (ID: e7a95e6780beb8eeaa6fde2bf9d593cc049f9bf8)

14. i can make the decision not to cheat when i ' m drunk , can ' t use the fact you had alcohol in your system makes no difference to the fact you were not drugged and raped you just cheated and think that people are retarded and that will work
   (ID: 64ea1587519466cc59d56652c6ba4938ba90f17b)

15. imho you are overthinking this . it ' s an ad for a pub , just use whatever . i ' d even argue , that using the more popular form would be better , even if it turns out wrong , since it ' s and ad , so it ' s supposed to appeal to most , not to the pendantic minority . hell , probably many people would assume the less prevalent form incorrect even if it ' s not , and think less of the pub because of it . marketing is the devil , i tell ya !

16. everything you see daily being a server at a country club . people really think just because they ' re members of a club that they ' re the pinnacle of human life .
   (ID: 8bf32ab488736d115cc40704cdd633a83334bb24)

17. i have many hobbies . if you are inferring arguing with you is a hobby of mine , i can assure you it is not . i just think you ' re wrong , and you clearly are unable to handle people disagreeing with you , as evidenced by you telling me to get a new hobby .
   (ID: 0f42d01192f24a5b8daeefbc608e876ee0b99d0f)

18. no i think you raise a valid point which contributes to the discussion . people get raped and murdered every day , it ' s horrific , but just because of her status in life , this woman got a lot of media attention .
   (ID: d4912bd11a6aaa98c91794eda03e9fafdfcf5c43)

19. i agree , the posts can be very dramatic but then again , i think it  s better for people to be able to express such feelings rather than not . i just feel that this sub should be a supportive environment no matter how melodramatic certain posts may seem .
   (ID: e7fb108169fa4af53970488336e7c4e934c92c2d)

20. most people on this particular subreddit seem to be able to blend and mimic pretty well i think that he is just saying it compared to the majority of the subreddit .
