2. dealing with you is like dealing with a first grader . there  s no deflection at all . you are commenting for everyone to prove that christ didn  t exist . the burden of proof requires for you to prove the extraordinary claim that he did in fact exist . end of argument . the proofing burden lies on you .

3. it did for me . i ' ve been team yen for the most part but once i saw the ending i felt like yennefers ending made the most sense . both are world weary , looking for an end to the ceaseless futility of politics and blood , and they find a true slice of joy in toussaint . triss ' ending was nice , seeing an optimistic tone for the future bit with no real closure . geralt is also entourage to triss now , following her whims . it ' s ok  its not toxic or anything but he ' s at a bit of a loose end . ciris is great too but it mainly cements the game as her story , not geralts . a different type of ending .

6. i was little when my mom took me to baskin robbins . i was given a cone with an oversized scoop of ice cream that looked like would fall off if i gave it a lick . and it did it was my fault though , not like the employee should be blamed . i cried , and a lady in line gave my mom money to buy me another one got ice cream in a cup instead of course . i remember that memory mainly because i felt bad and embarrassed for causing a scene for my mom , but i still am thankful for that stranger .
