1. no . i think it takes moral courage to say you love someone like over the phone if front of your friends and i don ' t care who hears me .
   (ID: c3739aee1cfa0a286d1056b5d9225e9d6e4f6547)

2. way i sees it , who gives a damn what you wear ? wear what ' s comfortable or what you like and don ' t care about what others think . as a friend of mine once told me  " no one ' s gotten laid in cargo shorts since vietnam " but that doesn ' t stop me . i have enough pockets for all the crap i carry daily .

3. i would say i ' d trade you for mine , but i don ' t think you ' d like them ! i can suggest a healthy little snack about an hour before bed , you might be hungry in your sleep .
   (ID: b51e03b426e81a08a491044ddebd04eb376b14b7)

4. he is under constant pressure deservingly so , his ratings are going down and he is instrumental to putin .  how do you keep a moron of this magnitude in charge ?  distract elsewhere and make him look like a hero . instability ? i don ' t think so . nobody in their right mind , including north koreans , will believe in a nuclear exchange . it is impossible for a variety of reasons .

5. died from cutting ? ummm isn ' t that like little ticks or scratches ? i don ' t think they normally go that deep . if even part of this is true this is pretty sad but

6. i like the idea except for buying extra votes . i think a better idea would be you can  t vote if you don  t pay taxes
   (ID: 6362531e71cf0653b3119ebe05583f7bbc6fb178)

7. i ' m not acting like a child . english is very important to me . i don ' t see why you think the argument was pretty . i see nothing lovely about this very serious issue at all . but back to the matter at hand . what can be done about this issue ? advise please .
   (ID: 5622a154bc0208151f378184cc7868a4ab53de39)

8. i don ' t think it matters . like your doctor said , the treatment is the same . what matters is what you experienced , how you feel about it afterwards , and what you do about it . the name you adhere to it means nothing .
   (ID: cb06a281615b40303789f4a2188bb0f5d55233b7)

9. i don ' t think anyone is expecting you to interact exclusively with women to be romantically involved with man and thinks lesser of you if you are friends with women . like it ' s a different story if most of your friends were women because not only is that unusual it implies you are bad at interacting with other men even though you would expect you to have more simular experiences , interests etc . implying you are in fact neither likable nor relatable to men .

10. lol lots of docs don ' t like to recommend pot . but it ' s quite helpful . glad you ' re doing better . i think my experience lately has been because of my recent move and the hospital i go to had gone through a bankruptcy and now has new staff .
   (ID: 2d26439362b22d8737b6d2a810c70fc3b9a3ddaa)

11. no way . i don ' t think i ' d like to be a kid in this day and age . potentially everything i do would be saved for posterity somewhere on the internet
   (ID: 873d7cdd437cc48c69447d68b6cd96b54580dae7)

12. ummm why does he have a physical collection instead of streaming like the rest of us do  and after that probably compare our tastes . why do men think women don  t watch porn ? we definitely do . hell i watch it and read it . sooooo
   (ID: 394249dcfbe84f52c2aac8eb4cb9009b69fefbe2)

13. oh shut your mouth , trying to be all " edgy " and all that . if somebody right now shot you in your gut and threatened to put another in your head , you ' d shit yourself and cry like a bitch for them to spare your life . life is worth living kid . sorry if you don ' t think so .
   (ID: a99f1c52d309446cc341a9edcdf4a3745fadcb34)

14. yeah i  m team human for sure  i don  t like those robots , they think there so awesome because they became conscious .
   (ID: 20d121bd3db06d7ffbef86a797a2a70ee0e9417e)

15. cuh  pree sun , like the commercials . if it  s one mispronunciation i ignore it . if it  s a repeat offender i say ,  i think it  s pronounced     in a way they don  t feel dumb hopefully .
   (ID: 5b21cc135fb593212a5256d44f50dc5eda5d9947)

16. think of how when you ' re tickled , and you can ' t move or breath . i imagine it ' s like that  meaning , you probably don ' t have any control over it .
   (ID: 97c013861c96e13a5ab9ceccc5a55ab66b372d4d)

17. i wish more women were like you . i think part of the reason why i don ' t date as much as i do is because i refuse to date anyone that would believe that the bar was truth and not a joke .
   (ID: cf8d77451599f70434f6a4807c679b44f5f79c74)

18. after that action today ? i don ' t really think so . solari is ruthless and this is what i like most about him . he will brush bale aside after how he acted today
   (ID: bd4a2272f70fc28a12f6d3327c76ba398ff0d19d)

19. do women like this actually get responses ? i don ' t have a penis and i think it ' s ridiculous .
   (ID: 2fe7bd3fe6a060a6106a6b0876106ad89acc0097)

20. yeah for sure you should text her if you think she  s attractive . don  t text the girl to try and get closer with the girl who has a boyfriend already though . it  s not like you went and confessed your love to girl  a  .
