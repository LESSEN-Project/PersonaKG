Total from this dataset: 631

1. it just seems so much less believable than a hamplanet pretending to have dropped her own jelly beans and then trying to claim them . i mean , given their usual psychological deficiencies , i still find it hard to believe a hamplanet would yell at you for taking your own shit back . and a word of advice  always go to the right . if they go in the same direction , just keep walking forward . never , ever shuffle with a planet . its gravity will cause events like you have described .

2. i just didn ' t like it .

3. how girls will hype each other up in each other  s comments of their posts like it  s so fake and you can tell most of them are just doing it to be nice

6. whenever there ' s an actual unpopular opinion , they ' ll just get downvoted . this comment section looks like it was written by a bunch of kids . unpopular opinions are what this whole sub is supposed to be about , yet you guys just cry whenever there actually is one .

7. like honestly it should be just called " harmful gender sterotypes " or something . so that " what about toxic femininity ? checkmate , sjew " isnt ' t the go to response .

8. my hope is to die with dignity faaarrr into the future but it will probably be something stupid like a freak accident or crash . idk i just hope im old and it ' s quick

9. my mistake , had no idea that trees had a discord . when i saw the op and then read your comment i was just thinking like wow this guy must hate strain central . lol thanks for clearing that up .

10. i might be wrong , but if only tom had said about his true nature to bea , she would have tried to change him a very disturbing trope for me or just wouldn ' t date with him that is actually fine , but the story would have ended at that moment . so i ' m really wrong , it is a problem with the whole movie , not with characters . it makes a conflict but doesn ' t end it properly . so in the final part of the movie when peter shows bea that he has blown up everything , it looks like " oh when rabbit showed me the same thing , now we ' re fine . what about the fact that it is you who put the dynamite everywhere ? nevermind . i ' m definitely too serious about this movie .

11. yeah , i like to go to the right side facing the yard . no better spot . then i look over and see some dude just standing there in the middle who might as well be afk . on the bright side , more kills for me and i level up quicker .

12. i was just trying to prove a point . which it seems worked . not trying to " get " at you . sorry if it seemed like it

13. i ' m from city of buenos aires , argentina . the fear from there being a small chance of being mugged is much worse than what happens here in tel aviv . missiles aren ' t a constant thing , i fear the robbers in argentina much more than i fear the missiles here in tel aviv . just like your car breaking down , it ' s not a problem until it very rarely happens . i ' m glad you liked my answer ! i always like to answer these questions so feel free to ask or message me . when talking about politics here i often try to be as neutral as possible whilst also separately transmitting my personal opinion . if you really liked what you read , maybe you should come visit . i ' ve been here since march and these have been the best months ever .

14. i ' m waiting to see if it actually is satire . maybe i ' m old enough to remember what satire is , maybe i ' m just not prone to knee  jerk reactions . a lot of the guys and gals overnight were copying what liberals do in being outraged without a full explanation . we ' re better than that . we ' re not shitlibs . facts are still important to us , act like it .

15. go in with the understanding that they ' re payed to help you through it , just like cashiers are payed to be nice to you and strippers are payed to dance naked in front of you .

16. lil xan is just one of many similar shitty rappers . i can ' t even picture what he looks like . at least justin bieber stood out .

17. being a cunt seems a bit like part of the job description when you ' re a debt collector . could be he ' s just trying to come off as intimidating in a few scenes .

18. simple is key . i ' d say any roll that has sauce , avoid . your best option is probably just getting nigiri  a type of fish ranging from traditional fish like salmon or tuna to more exotic ones like squid over a " log " of rice . just getting salmon is your safest bet imo . pic

19. i ' d change how scared i am to do shit without being told to do it , it ' s gotten to the point i just lay all day until someone tells me to do something , sometimes i feel like i ' m gonna be afraid to lay down because of getting screamed at for it
   (ID: 23546ae6e7b749eecf5b08a736a529690f163ed9)

20. i didn ' t . just blocked her everywhere . i felt like she didn ' t deserve closure .
