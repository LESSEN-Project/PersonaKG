5. i know this might be kind of fucked up , but when i see small humans being raised to act this way it makes me wish there was some sort of test that could determine whether or not you ' re fit to be a parent . i ' m sure a lot of people might be borderline , but those that fall into the " fuck no " category immediately receive a complementary hysterectomy or vasectomy .

10. you didn ' t answer the question . chicago makes it nearly impossible to get or own guns , so how are all these people getting shot ? also , why do all these crazies deliberately target so  called " gun  free zones " such as schools , theatres , churches , etc , ? because they know they ' ll have a target  rich environment of helpless victims ?

12. nevada is a certain kind of legal . it ' s not legal all across the state , only in counties with a low population . so illegal in vegas where the tourists are and where the human trafficking would have an audience . but even places where it ' s all legal has trafficking  i hope less though . i wish us at least took the stance of decriminalizing because we know a lot of these people are victims , not perpetrators .
