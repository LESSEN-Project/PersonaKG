2. yeah , the problem is , those guys at that price parade made it on tv because we either wanted to a support celebration of self or b scare straight people further into hate if the goal was b , they did so well they scared a gay kid into not wanting to be gay . mission " bigotry " accomplished .

3. i am regretting posting this . why did i have such a stupid lapse in judgement that i believed for one second that people on the internet were not going to be seedy about me doing the most natural thing and feeding my child ?

4. start up a convo with a discussion about a current event ex  did you hear how cold it is going to be next week . then lead into a short story of your own and ask if the other person can relate . that ' s how i get people talking .

5. ummm no . it ' s not the same . circumcision is a religious practice , and the people who defend it are subscribing to dogma . when i decided to become a mom i did a lot of research in preparation . obviously this doesn ' t make me an expert , but most actual experts agree that proper hygiene is equally effective at preventing diseases .

6. i guess you  re right , but the reason i did so is because people could ask for pretty much anything , so i my plan is to come up with a price after i understand the complete order . not to mention that this is a pretty casual thing anyways and we can probably point out a lot of other mistakes here .

7. ngton is very liberal , as with most college towns . then you get up around chicago it gets blue  er at least . i ' m pretty sure people aren ' t blaming the minority . no one ' s saying " fuck you , people who didn ' t support the homophobic bigots who wrote and passed this law ! " . they ' re saying fuck you to those who did .

8. how did you make this your career of sorts ? how do people trust you to be genuine and not look at you as someone who ' s doing it only for the money ? how do you market your services ?

9. i get you haha . i have a very common name and hate it . although i did something similar to that girl as i found as many people with the same full name as me and added them in the same group chat . turns out they  re all dead now .

10. the point of it is that most people did not initially understand that what you post on the internet lives forever  this would be particularly troublesome if you were a vampire and needed to reinvent yourself and identity every few decades . clearly not as a funny as i thought if i have to explain the joke .

11. that was quite shitty of her . lots of people use others as kink dispensers and then get mad when they ' re not comfortable with what ' s going on . you did the right thing in stopping .
   (ID: dfcca9c384a4fff7bbeb3cd1fb2f40aacb47fd7e)

16. first off , that is a terrible question . i would assume it ' s a brain chemistry thing and people are born the way they are born . maybe a better question is when did you figure out that you were a homosexual ?
   (ID: cac7da347c85dbd9a4149f86fa94b7dcc402ca52)

17. uhh you do realize that in the comments people said that this was a misquote right ? ahh i get it , you saw a chance to prove an atheist wrong so you jumped on it . did you do your fact checking on the other stuff they post ? probably not right ? only swing at the easy pitches huh ?
