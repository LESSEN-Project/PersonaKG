7. ffs , it ' s just hair . does that mean the hair on our heads is dirty , too ? eyebrows ? i ' ve heard women say it ' s " dirty " if you don ' t shave your legs every single day , too . i must be a dirty bitch .

9. this cannot be stressed enough . i feel that if my parents had praised me for my efforts rather than my strengths , i would ' ve become less complacent . instead , i gave up on sports completely , locked myself into the areas that came more easily and became a chronic underachiever , last  minute cram study kind of student . i don ' t blame my parents , though . i could change now , if i wanted to . i just see no point to the effort anymore . here ' s to all the lost opportunities . cheers .

10. do something that terrifies you . don ' t go kill yourself , but seek out something you wouldn ' t usually do and challenge yourself . regardless of the outcome ensuring you don ' t do something stupid and kill yourself , at worst you ' ll have a great story or you might just actually end up filled with the sense of pride for pushing yourself out of your comfort zone .

11. i ' ve been assuming that he character you don ' t choose just stays in dunwall doing whatever needs to be done .
   (ID: 7a8d1057f33a602e97473db59d81e1a2a35015ff)

12. i ' m very happy with where i am as well however there are still a lot of times i ask myself " what am i doing and why am i doing it " it wasn ' t meant to be taken as literal advice . more or less just , take it easy , let shit roll off your shoulders and don ' t worry too much .
   (ID: afc977e14ab83cd73dbc192e4c5b710baff09564)

13. i ' m pro constuctive criticism which i fully believe this was and i just instinctively gravitated towards this thread . i don ' t see how my comments could be seen as me having something against you as i didn ' t give my opinion about your art . as of your take on criticism we clearly don ' t agree with me saying it should be welcome anytime and you saying it should be welcomed only when asked for , so we should agree to disagree and wish each other a nice day as you have done here right now . have a nice day .
   (ID: 6e7de142c00c942e0e964f7e530a1abf562e7f0b)

14. i don ' t understand why you ' re being downvoted . you just stated your opinion and that ' s it .
   (ID: 18590dfbec2847acf310726c8e0182e2def1d744)

15. first of all , you can ' t blame being in engineering for your shitty social life . maybe you just aren ' t that charismatic or social of a guy . second of all , it ' s not all about the money . if you don ' t love doing math  science  engineering related work , then yeah , it ' s gonna be a grind .

16. v you ' re just coming across as creepy and pathetic now . and before you respond that you , " don ' t care " , you obviously do . you ' re posting gibes in a thread that was closed well before you posted on them , meaning i somehow affected you enough that you ' re stalking me . if this is the biggest thing in the world bothering you , i ' m envious . grow up . toughen up .
   (ID: 0b1bc1d5aa37988725a87d16e5fdab19e30e5b4c)

17. i don ' t see why you can ' t just ask this in the relationship advice and tag it as nsfw
   (ID: f4722b42ca77ea7e4c94f29b5d7875e07a87d91f)

18. i don ' t either but ragna said sofia was a nephilim of samael which means she is his child , so maybe he is just looking out for her , maybe not .
   (ID: bb5aad97e5f9243d2809e2017ae67353cfc0eb70)

19. wow your right . let  s just hope they don  t fuck it up
   (ID: a189febbe6cdf1cbdfab4caa7ce53ea7a90e0cf7)

20. gonna be honest i wasn ' t expecting that as a response so take a pat on the back and just don ' t answer any questions that peiple ask you in game chat
