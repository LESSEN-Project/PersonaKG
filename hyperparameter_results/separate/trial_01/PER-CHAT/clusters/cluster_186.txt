1. if it gets brought up to hr you will probably have to apologize and take a sexual harassment training . but i don ' t think a first offense is fireable . i could make you feel better with some stories about the people that still work at my job .
   (ID: 04a9ec1ad94f6aef9e0d0c77a31bd70a44ab100d)

2. people who call in drunk drivers but don ' t follow them . so you think that driver is worth reporting due to their dangedriving behavior it you ' re not going to follow ? then what ' s the point .
   (ID: 4764efc7ed164cb071bd066fb3014f20f9c558af)

3. i don ' t think that happens to the extent or in the way you ' re envisioning under current economic conditions . capitalism is about the bottom line at the end of the day . toxic people actually have been found to cost workplaces a lot of money and productivity , even if the toxic person is a " rock star "
   (ID: 21bb5634f13103a65cafda3c2d157095472f8623)

4. it takes all my restraint to keep from responding to every use of that word with , " please stop using that word . you don ' t understand it . people who do understand it think you ' re stupid "
   (ID: 3c06c226cba447ccab998867550632013ddec29a)

5. if taxes benefit is the only benefit of mariage i find it a little sad . of course there is benefit and so on . but when you talk about life about a lifetime together i stand when i say that it is a dangerous settlement cause i ce seen people stop trying once married . you think that because you be got the ring you don  t have to be nice , respectful , active or romantic anymore

6. i ' ve never understood when people think it ' s cheating . as long as you don ' t go out and stick your dick in another woman or man but instead jerk off at home to some random movie , you ' re not really harming anyone . tell that to macjesu lol
   (ID: e5ad32c4800d1df18cfdebed4a6bce78e8201f67)

7. it ' s not trolling . it ' s a subtle practical joke . i don ' t think this " troll " is intentionally trying to get a rise out of people .
   (ID: 97c013861c96e13a5ab9ceccc5a55ab66b372d4d)

8. arguments could be made for highly attractive people in general . the distinction you seem to be making is universalism , which i don ' t think is inherently immoral unless you were to abuse it , not much different from an attractive woman seducing a married man for his wealth .
   (ID: cedd98d2c7711b3146fe059a75be42067dc6c519)

9. all you have to say is " honestly , i don ' t respect the troops . i think they are a bunch of c students who knew they couldn ' t make it in a real job so they decided to kill brown people for money "
   (ID: effbf619a02ef4654ed4fc47a00345155706f5e2)

10. i don ' t think taboo is the right word but yes people do seem to be finding old cities that fix certain stories if you ignore enough facts .
   (ID: a28f00ba38e217547cc7dc092aa0183ed157e73d)

11. think it ' s amazing . many people say " we don ' t have the internet for that yet " , but in most of europe we do . for a casual gamer it would be amazing .
   (ID: 9f86578109b1b43e4653ed89d031a51536262f83)

12. when you use contraception that is " terminating something living " , i . e . , millions of sperm . of course you don ' t think that those lives are important , and certainly not as important as your convenience . it ' s very easy to decide what sacrifices other people should make .
   (ID: db160632c8977918e6cb62c5f5f03b339c357215)

13. i don  t think you should go around making fun of the way people look or their weight . that being said ugly is ugly and obesity is unhealthy . if you  re comfortable with yourself that  s great you should be . but you should also put forth a little effort
   (ID: d78765bdf49a3df577dd2523ce864393d4d0d2c9)

14. you don ' t owe everyone an explanation about who you are . so what if people think you ' re gay ? i was mistaken as a lesbian multiple times when i got a pixie cut , but who cares . as someone who works in advertising though , this is a frustration to me as well when working on branding .
   (ID: 0cfa8260f293a19407643946a56adbf8d27ad13d)

15. not if your education sucks and youre on internet to try and make others think a big penis does the job . lmao don ' t worry , most people saying this are arrogant or uneducated .
   (ID: 3eca81edf4e6bc73783677c148d86e9de5e6527e)

16. there are areas of the internet filled with people pursuing the answer to this question daily . i don ' t think they ' ve reached a conclusion yet .
   (ID: 51f92aca9b8ac96b7b17b7ae9c5ed57c4ba398da)

17. most of the people who says height doesn ' t matter are lying in my opinion . for me it does matter too . i don ' t care if a girl is 2cm " smaller " than me or 10cm . but i think it would be weird when she is way greater than me .
   (ID: dbff5f33856ec9afbd02edba3817f99e1fa12bba)

18. partially , but one of the areas reporting a major drop is murders . i don ' t think police are letting people off with a warning for that , even in the liberal elite bubble .
   (ID: b359a136167bf45b4584ccba69f5b8f3165d0c3d)

19. i agree . especially don ' t wave pedestrians across . by doing that , you may be making them break the law . the only exception i can think of is when traffic is gridlocked and we move forward doing the zipper to ensure people from side streets also get a chance .
   (ID: 817bc648b1f49714cdda34911d12db094977eb11)

20. many of my best friends are gay and i ' m a straight man . this kind of behavior makes me very sad . hopefully , western culture will trickle down some day , although sadly , i don ' t think it ever will . imagine there ' s no countries . it isn ' t hard to do . nothing to kill or die for , and no religion too . god damnit . kill your ego , people .
