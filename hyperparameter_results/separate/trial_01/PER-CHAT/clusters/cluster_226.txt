1. i can ' t even do the skyrim quivksave  quick reload after hitting a shopkeeper to refresh their stock . i feel horrible about it . even if i have no negative reprocutions from it i don ' t like hitting the old lady just for her to maybe have one more fish to sell me to finish that potion i ' m looking to make .

3. this is gross , i never understand why sex scenes are added into books or movies by chose , like how does it push the narrative of the story forward ? it doesn  t ? oh so the directors  writer just wanted an excuse to be a pervert and try to hide it under  storytelling  . don  t get me wrong i  m not saying it  s for all books  films by a mast majority . i  m not a writer but i don  t understand why they can  t say  jane doe and john apple returned to the room , with passion burning between them , they closed the door  apologies like i said i  m not a writer but i  m pretty sure everyone will get the picture of what  s about to happen . no need to get unnecessarily descriptive .

4. i don ' t like this . you then can ' t use spells regularly , i . e . for curse on hit or pcoc purposes , and as you say you are likely just going to put a different more multiplier in there anyway . trap is one of the best designed gems . it mechanically alters the way a skill operates i . e . higher non reflect damage , but you have limited charges and monsters have to walk over the trap .

5. if you don ' t hold the door for someone regardless of anything you look like an asshole . even if they look slightly too far away , you just look that much nicer .

6. just don  t listen to them . during high school my boyfriend and i had countless questions about getting married , having children or what our children might look like . in elementary i snapped at girl because i had two guy friends and was constantly asked if i were a item with one of them or if i liked them .

7. don ' t like reggae , but that ' s just my taste . no disrespect for the artists . however uninspired generic pop music is the worst . also i have no respect for " artists " that do not write their own music .

8. true . i was thinking that you don ' t pay extra money just for the horse , but it ' s still a bonus that you probably can ' t get through other means . i wouldn ' t waste it . besides , maybe the horse would come in handy , like if you were having difficulty with a regular horse in a timed mission or a race .

9. don ' t bother with them then , you won ' t have enough kindness for all of the chinese players . that may sound like i ' m not respecting my home country , but as you ' ve said , the quantity is just too big .
   (ID: 29ced65acf11e7d3808344de0029d7cd4f1e71f3)

10. hello . yes . yes . is that so . thought so well i just called bullshit and he says that is a fucking lie . don ' t you fucking hype me like that again .

11. i  ve never understood american in this way , state by state . what is the point ? at least on major decisions like this why don sent the government just say  yep , it  s legal  or  no it  s not  ?
   (ID: abd2d3c15975e586b4b74794df81b7ac62b7f321)

12. well if you don ' t like the effects , try to stay as sane as you can ! in rog its even easier as evil flowers are renewable so you can use them for nightmare fuel , but if you need to go insane just lower sound and pay attention to the middle more since its less affected , other than that . i ' ve got nothing .
   (ID: d485ff640de049893bff103c8ed123b255cdc448)

   (ID: 7a36b5607ec030b33a99723097f6d67b04c38d99)

14. then why are you asking us to help you ? sounds like this is just a thing you two do , which , to each their own . we don ' t either of you , how could we make any difference if you , an almost decade long friend , can ' t convince him ?
   (ID: f66930eecfddba4852a49cdecce9a946cae4914b)

15. remind yourself of the person you are now . when you ' re in uncomfortable confrontations like this , it ' s ok to just walk away . you owe them no explanation and you don ' t have to listen to their crap . we all make mistakes and we all have that young , partying phase . you ' ve grown and learned from it .
   (ID: 7689a2a9058addd2ffe1f9358160e5a94f32f5bd)

16. at the risk of sounding like a shameless self  plugger , there are plenty of different ways to make creative and original new gods . just take a look at some of my god concepts . i don ' t pretend to be some kind of genius but they ' re decent concepts and if i can do that , a proper dev should too .
   (ID: 6d1fd76ef9938f6921f8c6d4ebc6d970fa65261a)

17. and don  t forget to make sure your system has a serial number on the back because gamestop wiped my system clean for a trade in just for them to be like we can accept your system because it  s no serial number , after the fact they cleared my system clean

   (ID: f95736d146930b24368fd6d6020bbfcaea493859)

19. that ' s just stupid . i can ' t believe they don ' t let you do homework or do something else productive like clean up the school or something .
