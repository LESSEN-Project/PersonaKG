1. i read the article and now understand you a bit more . it ' s possibly a sort of regional thing . when speaking to someone with a thick amsterdam accent i can hear it a bit . i guess people in my circles don ' t pronounce it like  sh  and others do ? i ' ll certainly be more aware of it now .

2. look i don ' t understand the ex  gay aspect but yes most the culture is very strange . i dont like the flamming gay personalities , they are big turn offs . you will never see me at a stone wall or drag event , its not for me . i hate people whos lives are based off their sexuality . its a shallow personality type .

3. i actually agree with you on this . however , some reposts are desperate attempts to get karma . for example i have noticed on many subreddits that if someone posts something that gets thousands of upvotes and comments . within the next few hours , days even you will see tonnes of reposts of that same post by so many people . i mean come on that can ' t be a coincidence ? i don ' t like the unoriginality in that and i feel that deserves criticism .

4. i mean i get why people would like a preist but to leave cause you don ' t have a heal carry is kind of ridiculous , if you care about your party structure so much go to the boards and make your own party .

5. after so many horror stories of what happens behind the kitchen door , i am glad there are still people like you that make sure we don ' t all die .
   (ID: 3ffc2c82a46666a2774cd26439da56211e2aca6c)

6. the usual justification logical fallacy that god is real because you can ' t prove otherwise . anyone with any sense knows god is unfalsifiable and so any claim about god ' s objective existence or lack thereof is a belief statement , not a factual statement . however i don ' t really like bashing religious people , or anyone for that matter , you do you so long as you let me do me .

7. don  t . you either get your ass whooped or a possible assault charge if you win . you will always look like an asshole too source  have gotten my ass whooped by groups of people more than once

8. getting real tired of this dumb idea that comp and trim are now easy like you didn ' t have to do everything else on the req list . for comp the only difference is people who would ' ve paid a leech , don ' t have to , it hardly undoes everything else on the cape .

9. fuck you and your lawyer calling ass . people like you are what ' s wrong with society these days . the filming never shows what lead to the fights . i hope your kids don ' t love you
   (ID: 5bbba50b3f023fa844e1c966be3fb13c5263438b)

10. i completely agree . i thought everyone experienced it that way . i don ' t see the print , it ' s like watching a movie . i also picture people i ' ve not met in person , while i talk to them on the phone .
   (ID: f92d48b130dd6887025820188dce588035190a1c)

11. you clearly have no appreciation of personalities in people . i take back what i said . you would never be beautiful with a personality like yours . you  re clearly insecure and don  t believe in your husband . get a life , reddit trolls .
   (ID: 170d2db44dc5bdee2c5f1edbbacc843a5ad9377d)

12. another closed  minded fps addict . if you don  t like the switch then why talk about it ? none of you people understand the meaning of the phrase  leave it alone
   (ID: e7818c1499ac9903157abbe242ec6bd5b8e1a2ae)

13. so the accusations of one guy should always be believed , even though nobody else has ever complained about the same issues ? what  s the reason for that ? do guys like khedira , boateng or rudiger for example don  t have the balls to speak out about racism within the dfb ? are people really this stupid these days ? all the advancement of technology can never improve the iq of mouth breathers .
   (ID: ebc36040b76c955896cfcf83e94d298c81a45fb0)

14. i would like to but i honestly i don  t believe in what your saying , no one is actually happy and you can disagree but look around at everyone . no one knows what  s going on and honestly people who are successful are still not happy , the pursuit of happiness is something that isn  t attainable
   (ID: c7b03500469d01fff7d63dc804418c265ca4c838)

15. what about how people say " if you don ' t like america then you can get out " or " in america , you either love it , or by god you leave it . " this opinion is held by the vast majority of americans . so what ' s that tell you ? it tells you that almost all americans would be in favor of a law where it ' s illegal to not love america .

16. i never understood when people cared more about physical objects than the baby . it ' s like leave your cell so you don ' t forget your baby in the back seat all over again . facepalm
   (ID: 4b38cd2823db5360e68d7003d2cbf0fc85149552)

17. yeah i  m so sick of  the show has gone downhill since they went away from the books  hearing that from people who don  t even read the books , like , go read them if you  re unsatisfied

18. um , no the odds of him having a child are the odds of anyone else having a child . you either do or you don  t . and he could use a surrogate like plenty of straight people do too .
   (ID: 60a31a4071ae4962f2a308822d53a634a3760fa1)

19. i don  t understand ! why people like you never have any facts as to why trump is bad , it  s always the same vague arguments . be glad your bitch ass is safe from isis and if you ever decide to get a job and move out of your moms basement , trump has given us the greatest economy our nation has ever seen
   (ID: 6362531e71cf0653b3119ebe05583f7bbc6fb178)

20. there is a difference between using insulting language and directing it at specific individuals . i don ' t have a problem with someone expressing that they don ' t like black people for example . but there is a world of difference between saying that on your facebook profile for example and going to a black person ' s page and saying " you are a cunt because you are black " even in that case i would be reluctant to make it a crime . but as i said , i would need some persuasion to consider it criminal . it would depend on the circumstances . but there is a possibility i could be convinced .
