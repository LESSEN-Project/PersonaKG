1. i dreamt that i released a big and loud fart while sleeping with friends in a hostel . i don ' t know if that really happened or if it was just a dream .
   (ID: 50d020b325d00ce774cab7c5f30c4ae0e49ebf35)

2. absolutely nothing . the cellphone has changed the industrial world forever . my wrist hurt just typing this . i don ' t know what the future will bring but , i ' m sure we will adapt

3. and the point of staying in that room is to do nothing . don ' t talk , no sleeping , no distracting body movements or whatever . you ' re not even supposed to get off the chair . just sit there . be there . exist there . and get to know how deadly your own mind is , if left without distractions . that ' s how you will become insane .

4. i don ' t know about you but when i wanted money i noticed the missions , not the fact that you can buy money . i hated how bf4 was trying to rob me so i just played it normal version .

5. i always have to drag the toolbastart menu thing over to the right side of my screen . i don ' t know why or when i started doing it , but having everything at the bottom just feels wrong .
   (ID: f0d30d31e879077978622dde48ddd9e0f254b33d)

6. anything that happened before human observation . we don ' t know any facts about how the universe got started just ideas from personal interpretation of what we can see now .
   (ID: 0c5ed2f3844cbe1d6d08ce4430e4d70aa71c9b0f)

7. surely there ' s comfort in knowing there ' s absolutely nothing you can do about the eventual heat death of the universe . it ' s out of your control so just let it be . you don ' t know that this universe doesn ' t collapse down to a single point and birth anew with another big bang . either way i ' ll be long dead so it matters not

8. oof also he can leave he just don ' t i originally trapped him there and then freed him a day later but he stayed in the farm and almost jumped into the slime sea . i narrowly saved him from it as we don ' t know exactly what happens to them . further studies should probably be done on willing participants . all we know is that they seem unharmed . i believe he tried this as to protect himself from becoming a tar from plorts that escape the auto collector . i loved him too much to let him do that though so i kept him there to protect him if you still believe my actions are reprehensible i will except the charges . and as a commenter above said it does protect other slimes .

9. the rest of the post is sweet , just one question . wasnt it the parshmen who willfully gave up their spren to avoid extermination ? i know radiants  humans figured out how to capture them , but i don ' t recall them extracting spren from the parshmen .
   (ID: 40f1dd99755dca159ccdbdacafea183ed0a104cd)

10. yes . i don ' t know about all of them , but i have a cheap one i bought at walmart that i pretty much just use for my car because it ' s not powerful enough for any real work .
   (ID: 6513b981e1534ff5f0e9f18e4fbf04904704b27c)

11. yeah maybe , but i don ' t know what to say ' cause that explination has something that just doesn ' t click .
   (ID: 7b4dcbd9f2eb3dece09fadc9a192138dd376e2a5)

12. yes , i know . but without funding , what can you do ? kinda sucks at the moment since we  re just starting out . if we don  t find an animator we could try visualising the trailer from a different angle , maybe use stills .

13. i ' m p sure it is tbh , though it would have to be using inline transfer pumps to get the gas down 700m . i assume . i know for a fact the manufacturers don ' t warrant any greater lengths than 30m . so just how effective this system is i could not say .

14. i ' m just really weird about the inside of my elbow , my wrists and the inside of my knees , i don ' t know what it is but i can ' t even touch myself for longer than half a second in those places but i imagine they ' re the easiest places to get blood from . thanks for the advice , i really appreciate it !
   (ID: f94570a798e6234384bc3153319be2e6bdc36a39)

15. i don ' t know what you read , i would assume nothing . because i just google does sleeping on your right side cause bad dreams and all the results were about how sleeping on your left could cause bad dreams .

16. you don ' t need them . i know it hurts but focus on the happy and loving aspects of your new marriage . you ' re incredibly strong , i wish you two the best . show your parents just how happy you are . if that ' s not enough then too bad , their loss .
   (ID: 4f350b59a80efc55c353f9527b99d8b6f4fc403d)

17. exactly ! i am never cranky . he ' s just extra sensitive to my quite calculated and sometimes cutting responses  .  and yes everyone knows that best planning occurs late at night . i don ' t know what ' s wrong with him lol

18. when someone asks you for advice on something that you know a lot about or have lots of experience with . they don ' t take your advice and completely fuck that said something up . sometimes , " i told you so " just doesn ' t cut it .

19. it sounds to me you would be best served by english and  or balkan blends . don ' t go down the rabbit hole trying to define a balkan blend , you just know it when you taste one .

20. endless mode is fun , it does just repeat the same basic thing over and over , and i don ' t know if it ' s because i ' m bad or not , but it seems to get harder and harder the longer you go .
