2. you ' re wrong . pre  season still affects your mmr , that ' s why people tryhard , so they can get into a better league next reset . if he theoretically would make it into challenger , his mmr would still be as good after the reset .

4. it  s more of a personal issue , but i hate the fact that i have no comprehension skills . most people say that its the same , but my school recognizes that i have poor comprehension skills . i can  t write an essay without figuring out how to properly structure it or write a summary of a book that actually summarizes the plot . i have never been good at it , but for some reason , i can write books from my own creative thought . how this works ? i have no idea . also , the subject i always do poorly in is english .

6. some of them are probably good , but all you ever hear are the ones with the  plot  . not to mention the fan base . some people can watch anime and that  s the end . but when you dye your hair and express it to the world as a lifestyle and a culture , i always get that why are you doing this to yourself feeling .
   (ID: d7b05d638c1034010525fd3dd596dddf2ca7ab10)

7. yeah we all do . although personally i ' m so concerned about people associating me with good times that i try to to be understanding , helpful , entertaining . i can ' t imagine telling someone my life is worse when they tell me about their problems . being egozentric makes lonely .

8. the thing is , it doesn ' t matter how good someone is at their job . if they are a dick is disrupts everything . there are other people in the office that have jobs to do and no one gets special treatment .
   (ID: bf933bceda00c56a708db01701f57b6f5898c137)

   (ID: c68bfed6e6e814efb8a051ecc44c87a1e1a37779)

11. it  s much more expensive to buy a car and be without any warning warning that something needs attention or without recourse when something goes wrong . if you  re relying solely on the good word of the used car sales people , you  re doing it wrong . also , you can use a pre  purchase inspection to leverage a better deal should something be questionable .
   (ID: 20b719cfd5580c92fc37e5d83a20a191a90863e8)

12. there are people  oriented jobs in every field . try to find something specific that that you ' re good at , and then you ' ll get to make it social later .

   (ID: dcf932bdf0a81cd3f0139eac68aff6d0ef2c0bfd)

14. i ' ve never been good at social interactions , the guys at my elementary school liked to fight people and hit them for fun , and i wanted to get along with them . i liked to run and was very fast , so i would tell the boys in my class that if they catch me the could beat me up . i thought that we were friends until one of them broke my feet by kicking it so hard and broke my glasses . i guess i would have done whatever to have friends .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

15. if your kids caused any damage to other people ' s or a business ' s property , would you pay for it ? if another diner expressed annoyance because your child is misbehaving , would you apologize ? it ' s good that you actually try to manage your kids ' behavior .

17. a lot of people are arguing that these students chose to take on student debt , but in today ' s economy , it ' s nigh on impossible to get a good job without a college degree , and there ' s not enough scholarships for everyone to get one . so , students basically do have to go into debt to get a livable wage , so it ' s not really a choice .
   (ID: 80e7a756932413d48dd6ef4424552743c2bd06cc)

19. yeah , the workplace is definitely a little different . but you  re still absolutely right . you train people how to treat you and what to expect from you . even good friends with honest intentions can take advantage of your generosity without realizing it .
   (ID: 9b099fc6a5044a636b3e10ef3ad414e6539006ab)

20. oh ok cool , one thing to remember about living in texas , idk if they do it there , people always say hi . if you tune them out , you miss out on great friendships . good luck
