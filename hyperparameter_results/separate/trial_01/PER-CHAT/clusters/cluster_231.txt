   (ID: cdfe8425c4239c926bbc69037b1e955de45be4ba)

4. i think someone said that was the goal . movie intro then a series ? something this epic , i feel like there ' s no way the movies wouldn ' t let a bunch of fans down .

5. i think he ' s doing it because it ' s gonna him more views and coverage . regarding the secrets , i won ' t even believe that lunch rush is pulling petty tricks like that store was doing . that man is a goddamn angel .

6. as a gen z kid myself , i can co firm that we  re basically millennials , or we act like it at least . some of the early 2000s birthdays think they are millennials .

7. i think it was an ok horror flick . i haven ' t noticed any theory like the one you ' re describing . actually you ' re the first one to tell me about it , but that ' s not bad at all , i like theories . the reason why i didn ' t think this movie was great was because there was no suspense at all . something like a dark basement should be terrifying , but here it wasn ' t even close to it . that ' s what the film is missing .

8. guilt tripping ? thats what you  re trying now ? well fine , i  ll say it . i hate your  world famous pancakes .  i think they taste like world famous shit
   (ID: b3b4d94d5f9f82cab08323192635856887d3eb51)

9. i ' d really like to be able to make my own character but be limited to one per playthough . i think it would make it that much more crappy if they died , knowing you personally created them .
   (ID: bc52f733f5124fd4e4cd78ae1552a887a929dfb4)

10. kingdoms of amalur is one that comes to mind . i prefer it to skyrim but it never took of like i think it should have .
   (ID: 5dc1e0203cb86a245c4ede5cb73923b295b1fdc8)

11. i didn  t think of this but i do that too ! it helps me be more productive around the house if i have a bunch of cleaning to do that day . it  s like a pick  me  up .
   (ID: be25689b94c143a66dbdf8d935f1a2a00d939140)

12. wouldn ' t a plastic card like a gift card be easier for someone to carry around ? they can put it in their wallet , and mentally i think it will probably have a very similar impact .
   (ID: 7fb41a41bab8f3fd281fb344be32c595c5c5a0ec)

13. i think if you stay on reddit for long enough and stick to subreddits you like reddit will become very fun for you . that  s what worked for me .
   (ID: 4d538652ddb46c56c621bbd0bfe4685f91934ffd)

14. i think its ok if it advances the plot along . like if a character is sleeping with someone to get information or something . otherwise yeah it seems kinda dumb .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

15. would you like to talk about it ? for example why you think you ' re a " useless fuck up " ?
   (ID: 236234cf652ef401d587ea393bf8d05c158238b6)

16. " dear death rows of reddit , what was your last meal ? " i think the question was like that
   (ID: 4b127841179d58078b4fbc1377158cb136f3156f)

17. i now understand how eating a cheese wheel might make you think you have magical status buffs like ' resist fire ' .
   (ID: 8304dcaaf46416d72f3c51625c1ea48db7478b13)

18. yes . that sounds like a great idea , when i imagine it in my head i think it would most probably fit in very well . can ' t wait to see what you do with this .
   (ID: 92ca586a34bba3800ab87075933566d5b345b6b4)

19. it tastes exactly like what you would expect a piece of fruit from a cactus would taste . i ' m being dead serious . that ' s the only way i could think to describe it . after i told my husband this , he tasted it , and said the exact same thing
   (ID: 854fece503b60c994d3291263ce8495e5048d976)

20. that  s all i could find about yanderes . the rest of of it was lolicon  shotacon which isn  t allowed , not unwholesome but still very scaring island really fucked me up send wholesome stuff please , rape  cheating obviously not wholesome , and incest which i refuse to post . so next i think i  ll start posting monster girls and my other favorites . also is stuff from sites like hentai2read and hentaicafe allowed or are only nhentai and imgur allowed ?
