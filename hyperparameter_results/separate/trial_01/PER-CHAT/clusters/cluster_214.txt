1. who said he stole it ? drunk guy says  you owe me  digit  and suddenly it  s because of theft ? i  ve had people spill their drinks on me at a bar and insist i owe them the cost of the drink , so there  s likely more to this story than what you  re assuming . it  s so sad that you call it a magic word as if it doesn  t hold years of offensive connotations .

9. i once parroted a phrase my mom said to me whenever i asked " why should i do that " to a classmate in middle school honors biology when i asked him to sharpen my pencil while he was heading up to the sharpener . he asked " why should i do that " jokingly . i responded " because you ' re my slave " he was black luckily we were cool only the six people at my table heard me say it . it also helps that my table knew i wasn ' t racist or that simple phrase i uttered while half asleep could ' ve snowballed real fast into something ugly . i still cringe digit years later thinking about it

15. lol . hey ! i resemble that remark ! i  m from bakersfield , born and raised for digit years . can  t deny it isn  t a fantastic place to be , and can  t deny i  m not exactly shocked about this story . shootings happen quite often there . it is a bit unusual for this whole series of events to occur , but the people down there have mostly gotten quite destitute . there  s a lot of gang violence from people moving to bakersfield from the bay area and the los angeles area for cheaper living , which invites some unsavory people along .
