1. most religions are against homosexuality . perhaps just by allowing this group to feel confident there ' s the appearance of impartiality is enough ? or are you against gay people feeling confident in government services ? see how easily the " problem " becomes a solution ?

   (ID: 8889164d293212be4363a4ea1d178a2037bbbd00)

4. people who park half in a handicap spot legally , and half on the no parking zone that is meant for side loading vehicles with a ramp . yeah i realize you need extra space on your drivers side , but you just as easily back into the spot and not block the loading zone so the poor sap that parked in the spot next to you can ' t get their ramp down .

5. the thing is they really do deserve the hate , they always whine about how they shouldn  t be getting hate , and they wonder why people hate them . also they just try to deny their mistakes instead of taking responsibilities .
   (ID: fe6b5f149493beeede86d9d6a693086413c017de)

11. i ' ll bite on this ridiculous generalization with a question for you  " patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all others because you were born in it , " paraphrased from shaw  why can ' t we just be decent people instead of dwelling on nationalism when it suits our agenda ?
   (ID: 1f43afabf95308ba2ce8ed409ce10835352cb6a3)

13. now that i  m done spamming ora on all your stupid jojo trashing , your memes are absolute shit and beyond cringy no one would find them funny and there  s not even any real criticism , you  re worse than people who hate anime just because they hear other people who hate it
   (ID: ef181804526093c6a2f6a4e0fba8b4f18fc0e775)

14. they do profile people from that part of the world now . just sayin '
   (ID: fb3e27f02415a8e4cac0badee38912f6b27a5a14)

15. no fucking idea why people consider it just fine and normal to let a kid do that . for the record , i have nothing against gay people , or whatever you consider yourself , you do you . but what i won ' t do is allow my child to make choices that can have serious consequences when they ' re too young to fully grasp what they are doing .
   (ID: 354ccb8fa605f060064763ae03fd7b63119da224)

16. he acts in a way that is not racially discriminatory then where are the people of color on his ? there are obviously more than racial issues going on here , it ' s corruption too . this is just the first thing that came to mind . i ' m sure there are examples for people that care enough to read about what trump does . personally , i view him as a worthless figurehead , not someone to pay attention to . also , i ' d suggest just forgetting that idea exists , because anyone intelligent immediately realizes it ' s bullshit .
   (ID: 3f03e19f839d6382fd2b368797fa9feed1073b58)

17. thank you but it ' s okay . i ' m just curious about other people ' s experiences
   (ID: 4c1d1da1f377f39d21bfa3f108282288a958f0b0)

18. i mean it depends on what music you listen to but talking to people always helps . just talk to your mum or dad or anyone that you trust to confine in and they will support you and that will help you believe me .
   (ID: 77ba34486e72dd1f257e4180b0a041ce79dfece7)

19. not everyone feels great after that . just pointing this out . some people notice a stark decrease in their drive  motivation and energy levels .
   (ID: 13626444db009d77d0a3e729a17693fa76b35e98)

20. not generally you might find some people who could be a tad finicky about it when you tell them . but you  ll just as easily find a guy accepts ands loves you for who you are . past and all
