1. the godzilla oppenheimer teaser . i ' ve been a fan as long as i can remember . my local channel would do godzilla double features after cartoons every saturday morning back when there were only four channels and then after that bullshit that came out in digit , i thought i ' d never see another good godzilla movie . when that teaser broke at comic  con i almost cried .

2. if you run into this situation , not many bloodline members left , none of them can be brought to court , try marrying them to someone horny anyway . even if it doesn ' t bring them to your court yet , allowing them to begin breeding future members to invite while securing it ' s survival is a good start . then , move on to the next bloodline . now , digit years later , check back and hopefully you ' ve cooked up a new batch of bloodline members , maybe some lowborn shithead who will take an invite .

3. some sound advice there , i also sooner have a lower sub count and high view count because i am making youtube video for fun at the moment so my sub count is around digit at the moment , also what i have noticed in the amount of random subs i get who i am sure have not watched any of my videos . well done getting digit subs and good luck in the future with your channel .

4. i have him lvl digit and my orochi looks pretty good considering . high level doesn ' t always  best outfit . my roach used to put high reps to shame outfit wise , the higher rep , the easier to make the outfit , it ' s all about how you piece it together into one that makes it or breaks it

5. been a blazers fan since digit and this is the most fun team to watch since the drexler days in the early digit ' s . hopefully nurk comes back strong next year and we make a good push to at least make the wcf . fun times ahead , keep the faith .

6. i  m digit and have lived in green bay my whole life . i  ve found vikings fans to be the worst . they  re never realistic about how good they are and they care more about the packers losing than they care about winning . bears fans are usually respectable and not nearly as big of idiots as vikings fans . lions fans are cool to

7. well good could be something along the lines of making all healthcare acessable and free evil is tricky due to the definition but probably make it that nobody can ever put a usb the right way in the first digit tries and for myself , the ability to not have the negative wish effect me

8. it  s been that way since myteam first was introduced in 2k13 . its worst now since 2k gives almost every card that comes out a good digit ball

9. i was told years ago that " there ' s no such thing as too much amp , " meaning if you have two 50w speakers , a 200w amp will drive them without risk of damage , but a 50w amp could do harm due to the lack of power and inherent distortion , which is bad for speakers and listeners , natch . as a result i have tried to always have more watts in amplification than the sum of the speakers . that , and never run at digit  across all points . another way to look at it  the more horsepower in your car ' s engine , the easier it is to run at any speed because it has a high maximum output . less horsepower , lower max , more problems as you approach the top end . oh , and you ' ll never a good loud if the source is crap streaming , satellite , or most fm in the states .

10. my net is pretty bad so i always had to solo tridolons . started with goatman too but switched quickly after i found out what gara was capable of . not even once a lure died on me digit  dr really makes them tank a lot , since it also applies to shields , meaning they rarely get damaged at all , but the main point is her wall . keeping out a bunch of vomvas with digit effort makes the fight much quicker , since you negate quite a bit of healing on the final phase . i really suggest checking her out when you feel more comfortable , you will find quickly how good she is for sentient hunting

11. i remember i had one from christmas of digit and dropped it thankfully it had a case . good times .

12. das wird am sankt nimmerleinstag passieren . this will happen on the saint nevermore day also , if someone asks something completely absurd such as " raise my pay by digit  " the phrase " wovon traumst du nachts " is a good reply .

13. yup . it was tough . we had a tough few years of marriage because we weren  t ready . but now , digit years later , it  s all good .

14. yes , i ' m thinking the same . the digit is still doing a good job so i may even wait for the 7t .

15. probably because you ' re speeding and they ' re not good enough drivers to expect your disregard for the law . also , jokes on you . if you hit them , you ' re digit  at fault if you hit them in the rear in the us .

16. i recently received my jersey package , although they are not authentic but replica , but the quality is good , stitched and price is about digit  , the website is  it can helps , at least i thought .

17. aw , actually i am using a mic from amazon . i thought it would help my audio compared to my old videos . maybe it ' s not really good . regarding the background , i made a new setting with no distractions to help the viewer focus on me . thanks so much for your feedback !  digit

18. yes definitely . it  s an amazing experience the characters are absolutely magnificent and arthur is one of the best protagonist i  ve ever had the pleasure of playing with . the realism is out this world as an example it actually matters where you shoot the animal and what you shoot it with and the type of ammo . it  s so good digit  digit would recommend this beautiful experience .

19. i usually have digit pairs of gitch and socks , enough so that if there is a sudden water shortage you aren ' t completely screwed . bring books or get a kindle  kobo a few pages of a good book after watch to calm your mind before sleep always helps me . depending on your cox ' n you might get away with a foam mattress topper , it can help . above all , embrace the daily routine of being at sea . once you settle into it life will go by surprisingly fast .

20. i use the app mint . it ' s good at tracking accounts for you . otherwise a good old fashion spreadsheet works . the tip i have is to make sure only bills hit accounts . pull out your spending money and stick to cash for everything else . this will help in visualizing what you actually have and not accidentally overspend . you ' ll get a hang for it and no longer need the control . also , look at cost per meal c  m . set a goal and look at what that meal cost you . set daily limits and aim for them . for example eggs cost  digit . digit a dozen here . eat digit and that is roughly  digit . digit a meal . made toast ? loaf cost divided by usage . these are all accounting techniques .
