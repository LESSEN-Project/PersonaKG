1. " detoxing " it ' s actually really bad for your system huge lack of protein and lipids and is basically just a massive scam to trick people into buying products that otherwise would never sell like who the fuck would drink beet juice on a regular basis

2. for the most part . the problem as i see is that the investgation was long and publicised . its been at the forefront of the news cycle for almost two years . people are burnt out on it and tired of the far left and far right . its like listening to two children argue and fight with each other . at some point everyone just wants the politicians and judiciary to shut up and run the country .

3. people really should try to be more than just their sexuality . i ' m not defined as a person simply by where i stick my dick . if your whole identity is centered around who you like to fuck you have a very shallow life .

4. i hate the ones that give you a last name and nothing else . but , even worse are the ones that just stand there , mute ! like they need a prompt or some sort in order to talk ! people lose all social skills or filters when they step through the doors .

5. i haven ' t read much about it but feel like its being portrayed as a demonic religion due to a small percentage of those that kind of made their own version of it . i have met a many muslims when i sold cigarettes wholesale at sams club and i would have conversations as if i was talking to a friend about random shit . unless shit hit the fan they were very nice people and then they would always take it out on the boss so i just sit back and watched lol

6. it ' s a deal as big as you make it . chill fellow psychonaut you ' ve just experienced ego death  like experience from a dream . happens to people . it ' s not strange to have dreams about difficult situations from the past , psychedelic or not .

7. how proud people are of themselves when they ' re shitty to someone for no reason . obviously , i understand it comes from a place of insecurity and probably some depression , but you really expect me to laugh because you were a bitch to a stranger because you thought she was dressed like a whore ? that just makes you look bad .

10. you  ll have so much bad advice from all sorts of people  just smile , nod , and ignore . i mean , it  s not like your doctor is going to come to your house and check whether or not you  re breastfeeding , right ? the age at which you wean your child is no one  s business except you and your child . period .

11. you ' re anxious and in college ? i ' m not sure about yours , but my university offers free counseling . check administration . college requires a lot of personal growth , and the thought of that can seem overwhelming . you can do it if you set your mind to it . hundreds of thousands of people just like you have made the transformation before .

12. i got rid of every social media and only use reddit . i literally dont miss it at all . i can ' t say i ' m less insecure or anything , because people on reddit are harsh as hell . but the anonymity and the unimportance of friends  followers gives a lot less pressure and there ' s no popularity contest . i dont feel like i have to prove myself to anyone , i can just browse . its refreshing

13. i just put that as a disclaimer , because i felt like if i didn ' t people would come swarming in here to tell me it ' s a bad idea . i have complete faith in our relationship though . and you ' re right . patience and understanding will be key . thank you for your kind words .

14. yeah , sucks to see bitlife get more buzz like articles and youtube videos . i remember even seeing people saying how original is their logo , knowing they just got it from instlife
   (ID: 2f03a8d589defb9434044b9ef9bfffc676e2b49a)

15. how could you imagine this would not be offensive ? it ' s like asking " why didn ' t black people being discriminated against not just wear white makeup or get their skin bleached ?
   (ID: 4f27bcf41b1aa25bc869638c7cb7769295237639)

16. you realize all these crappy comforting folk wisdom sayings like " you can do anything you put your mind to , " " the truth always comes out , " " what goes around comes around " and " you are as happy as you make up your mind to be " are true only just often enough to keep people believing in them .
   (ID: 523373521c35d1ab7b6f0045d4586896b61d0d3d)

17. i get that people are hoping but there ' s no evidence . even cnn has moved away from it . just last week the hill ran an article that it was looking more and more like an inside job and they ' re vehemently anti trump
   (ID: 87d47758fd6ac7d7832d83dac9755451ebc44cc6)

18. does foster actually exist ? i always thought it was just a joke we were playing on americans . kind of like asians selling feng shui to white people
   (ID: 56b0fa955cab3b71ba6368e8c4ad684a45da92dd)

19. i guess i  ve bought into this relatively new  passion  society . seems like everywhere you go people expounding on their passion and how great it is . i would be happy just enjoying the journey .

20. agreed . warren doesn ' t get a fair shake because people are hung up on one single non  issue that was used in an attack ad against her by scott walker during the senatorial race of god knows how long ago . she ' s the one person consistently espousing policy , which is what paul and tj and all the rest say they ' re hungry for the dems to do . just like they ' re too lazy to vote , they ' re also to lazy to pay attention to what the candidates are actually doing and saying .
