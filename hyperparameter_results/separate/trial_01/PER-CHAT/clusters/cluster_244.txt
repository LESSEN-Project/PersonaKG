1. you are not weird ! it happens to me every time i finish a series i love . it feels like a big loss .

2. can ' t downvote you as i experience this all the time turning into my driveway . it bears back to the right and is steep . i can ' t count the times a driver behind me has to lock up or act irate that i am coming almost to a standstill . it is like they are driving in the world that they wish existed , rather than the one that does .

7. i got into dnb relatively late compared to a lot of the heads on here2007 , so my response will probably reflect that . i ' ve always considered pendulum beginner dnb . pendulum  hold your they had a real mass appeal and plenty of chart toppers . pendulum  if you find yourself as hooked i was , you ' ll probably try to figure out what makes dnb so awesome . is it the massive builds and insane drops that make your skin crawl ? telemetrik  or maybe its the rolling warm bass ? blue sonix  luv me logistics or that signature jungle sound with complicated drum work ? natty ruler  tubby the realm of dnb is huge and the rules are loose . even the drum snare pattern has been completely rejected with the emergence of the halftime or drumstep sub genre . say nothin  jubei ft . if your still listening , i recommend you take time to have seat , kick back , smoke a bowl , and find out what you like and start building a collection like the rest of us . you ' ll be a head in no time . ps l . a . o . s  panda

8. while on the topic of price . i have quite a few cards that are playable now . is it best to sell now while they  re new and being played or to hold onto them ? for example , i  m talking about cards like dedenne gx and gardy sylvy . sr items fire crystal and triple a energy . i do plan to keep my reshizard though as that  s the reason i started collecting hard copies again . honestly wanting to trade it my pulls for more packs so wondering if now is the best time to sell .

9. after spending more time than i ' d like to admit trying this , my definitive answer is no

10. i had a dream about me watching an earthquake affect my room , and then i woke up . then a few months later , i have a dream that connected to all of my dreams , especially the one i mentioned . i was scrolling through discs , like scrolling through instruments in garageband , and every disc had one dream that i had the past few months . it also had dreams that i had forgotten about for a long time . after scrolling for a while , i press on a disc which replayed the first dream exactly .

11. i kinda like the idea of being a guy ' s first because they ' ll remember me forever . but sex with someone who ' s inexperienced can be a bit awkward . it ' s a turn on when a guy knows what he ' s doing . you ' re still young though , and you still have plenty of time to learn . i ' m sure lots of girls are fine with virgins .

12. maybe they are offering to go with you ? i have freinds , but like time to myself too . the important thing is you are happy .

13. your reefs reeves ? are beautiful ! ive been reading all afternoon about cycles and filtering etc instead of working lol . it definitely does seem like it would be overwhelming to actually do . i will message you if i need the help when the time comes ! thanks !

14. i actually agree with you . if you wanna do it , sure so long as there are no limitations . but it  s not appropriate to do it in movies that take place in a certain area such as china . can you imagine how stupid it  d look seeing a chinese speaking black guy in china in a movie about the dynasties ? but in movies like dear simon that are literally about homosexual love , it  d be rude and inappropriate to make the main character a woman at the same time ,

15. yep same for me . hasn  t changed in the whole time i  ve owned my watch . i wish they  d do like an app of the day

16. i feel like knowing would make the time i ' ve got left that much more meaningful . i wouldn ' t try to stop it , because that knowledge would have taken into account my awareness of it , and ultimately lead to it .

17. you guys have any idea why this npc came at me like this ? its a old clip but i had no idea at the time how to get it on reddit .

18. that  s so cool , do you have a land you like to mentally spend time in most often ?
   (ID: de79afced534832339dd1f700d1eabdff8d07986)

19. excellent . and you still have a couple of weeks , so if something looks like it isn ' t working properly or it turns out i ' m full of shit , you have time to fix it
