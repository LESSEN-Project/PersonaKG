1. thanks , even if no one donates i hate to think that i  ve annoyed someone in the past with a shitpost or an argument on some sub and they follow me just to downvote what i post regardless of the topic , i tried not to make it about  oh i  m awesome and doing this thing for charity because i  m so kind  and i  ve reread it and can  t personally see anything in there which is downvote  worthy .

3. nta . her friends only think you  re the asshole because that  s just what girl friends do for eachother . i  m sure they also heard a very redacted and glossed over side of the story , based on however much your ex remembers from that night .

4. you think you wanna lose weight because your mind is already tricking you , but you really just wanna get toned . please tell somebody in your real life , it  s already slipped from your control ! it pains me to see how young you are

5. you can never stop a single crazy no matter what draconian rules you think up . they will still be crazy and we will just be freedomless , passing reactionary legislation that doesn ' t do anything but pandwr for votes .

6. you won ' t believe me , but after meditating , without think , got up and tore my marajuana plant up and was shoving it down the garbage disposal , when an invisible entity whacked the back of my knees , causing me to fall flat on my back . then both of my arms were pinned to the floor , and i felt this thing stepping on my chest and staring down at me and into my mind , as if to make sure everything in there was kosher . it didn ' t feel manevolent . just huge and powerful and ancient . it seemed to be satisfied , and i was released . i ' ve never meditated since .

7. i think they combine transparent background with letters that are the same color as the background in light  dark mode and that they put a     patern where letters cross so its possible to put text over itself . just my educated guess .

8. i think i might have the stupid because i spelled you ' re as your . just ignore that and move on .

9. he is a wizard . he uses black magic . and i am just your ordinary redditor . so , how do you think my paintings turned out ?

10. i think this is so amusing just because it doesn  t require physical exertion . actually having to do it isn  t entertaining whatsoever .
   (ID: 5b59b30ecdf3a93e4634d1600b3020fd8e9dc7e2)

11. well based on your account name i ' d think you are in the navy , and i am almost certain that as soon as you find out you are pregnant you are unfit sea and alongside . i mean i could be wrong , but if you are posted to a ship go talk to the pa , and see what they say . they won ' t tell the coc what ' s wrong , just that you are unfit alongside .

12. you think a decade and a half of blacklisting , effectively destroying his ability to have a career and a prosperous life , is a just reactioon to what you classify as dumb mistakes ?
   (ID: 9b6ee533e853c768cc140f122ed313d4d7550b5a)

13. do you think it could still be just kind of a cultural difference ? definitely weird behavior to me though
   (ID: d039cf7c78de364a0282012d22914d15befe6eab)

14. you ' re going to need to look at workers . they ' re able to run in the background but that ' s not a guarantee of success either . workers can get turned off due to the os trying to conserve resources or just because the user has gone to a different domain but workers are the only thing i can think of that ' ll get you most of the way there .
   (ID: 455257ac4ca962f5cb67f4d9010457eb6ace424e)

15. what on earth are you talking about ? interviews ? have you interviewed my partner ? i think you are just making a lame attempt at trolling now .
   (ID: d02dbb1cf70aa95df2b9f1bbd0a0c5bf0a966933)

16. why is everything here with centurion ? i dont have a problem i just think its weird out of all characters cent is used in all the posts

17. heres an idea . if any of you guys hate suzanne vega or leonard cohen ' s music , just be honest , my feelings won ' t be hurt if you think they suck monkey balls !
   (ID: 9d9222851792c0966d644b25f98a14486f3509b3)

18. i  ve never heard of that before , that  s so unnecessary . i think at a certain point they  re really just screwing themselves out of money and will stop . i get it for alcohol reasons , but otherwise . why ? dumb on their part , and for you !
   (ID: a9118b0ccd836fe14487d81c4f51a4b9c889be97)

19. boy calm down . i ' m speaking from experience . i used to be that girl and it was because i wasn ' t happy in that relationship and kept seeking thrills elsewhere . if there ' s something missing in a relationship you need to talk about it , definitely , but these are signs of infidelity . never called her a whore by the way . i just think she ' d rather be with someone else .

20. they really are ! funny thing is , it  s a brand new house so there are no previous owners . we think they belong to someone else who has moved in near by and they  re just exploring at the moment . haven  t had a chance to check for collars etc yet .
