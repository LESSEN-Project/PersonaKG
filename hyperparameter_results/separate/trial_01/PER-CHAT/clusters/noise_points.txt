6. i don ' t think you ' re dumb at all . here you are asking questions ! that ' s what sets smart people apart , curiosity and the willingness to learn ! just remember that one day you may find yourself without your tech , so try to learn the old fashioned way of doing some things so you aren ' t totally screwed if your phone breaks and you ' re alone . at your age you ' re rarely alone but in just a couple years , the stakes will be higher .

8. too many people do this only because their friends are doing it . besides being sure of what you want permanently stamped on you for the rest of your life you should maybe first figure out why you are doing it . if it ' s just to look cool and or do it because everyone else is doing it then that ' s probably the wrong reason for doing it . fads have a tendency of going out of style is something you might want to consider .

13. it can be a vice but it can also be a lot of other things . i like to think of it as a product of evolution since it  s a very useful trait for a group to have similar ideas about unexplained phenomena . even in general it can bring people together which is useful for survival . basically it  s like anything else . you can use it as a vice or you can use it in a bunch of other ways .
