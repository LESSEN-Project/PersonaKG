16. when people draw a happy face like this . if you have the ability to draw a normal happy face , do it . the reason even exists in the first place was because you couldn ' t type out a normal happy face .

17. what has helped me is blinders . seriously . i got a pair of wrap around style sunglasses that gives me the choice of ignoring while being able to see people next to me . they can ' t tell if i can see them , so i can easily act like i can ' t see them . obviously i react if someone comes swerving at me , but when people are being aggressive dbags , i can ignore the fact they are trying to get over usually at the last minute .

19. those people have problems , but they are clearly in need of someone to talk to . maybe you should give them a call when they post something like that , and maybe get some professional help for them too .
   (ID: 1ae31d9fb933833cb408a560716dff905a2959fe)

20. you seem like a reasonable person , who really puts in the effort to assume the best of intentions , and put yourself in other people ' s shoes . especially those that you disagree with .
