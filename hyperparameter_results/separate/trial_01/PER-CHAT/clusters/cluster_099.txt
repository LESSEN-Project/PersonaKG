2. oof ? how is it shit ? how did she stay from the character in any way ? i always thought the whole " angry incel " thing was made up , but reading this thread has proven i was wrong about that . you guys need to chill , what is wrong with her enjoying her hobby and characters she likes in games ? i think it is dope .

3. i think skyrim did it very well indeed . it was by no means fast , but not tedious either , in fact felt very fun ! but for me the best levelling up system belongs to final fantasy

4. nta . he knows someone is moving in may and still left all his stuff ? what did he think the guy moving in is going to do with his own stuff ? offer to help your friend move his stuff out to a storage unit . i ' m also shocked you havent discovered this side of your friend , being in business with him and all and his best friend .

5. perhaps , but as i said in a previous post , " inform , " not preach . as i said , sometimes problems are caused . i can think of at least one thing that is worse  living with yourself when you saw a wrong and did nothing , knowing a child would suffer .

9. so one of my friends literally broke his chromebook in half . it was one of the older ones with the normal screen and keyboard . i think he put it against a wall or something and stepped on it . he did it on purpose though because everyone else had macs . the chromebooks were loaners .
