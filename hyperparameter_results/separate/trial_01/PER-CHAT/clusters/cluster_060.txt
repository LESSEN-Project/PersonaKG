15. mine  so it was me , my brother and our cousin ken , spending the night at our other cousins house , lets call her rukia . rukia ' s mom used to own a really old but never worn down recliner that was blue and the arm rest opened up to cup holders . in this event we are all children . i pass by the room with the chair in it and there was a man sitting there smoking a cigar and a suit and a funny looking hat . he saw me and smiled and motioned me over to him repeatedly . i had no idea who he was and i was frightened and i hid in the dirty clothes hamper . years later we discussed this all together and it turns out that all three of us had the same experience with a man in a hat in the blue chair . i guess he was a ghost .
