6. since this platform is free for everyone to post and comment all kinds of things i won  t take your note on keeping my nose out especially from someone with attitude you possess . by all means you deserve to be called out and maybe you should take a note about changing your attitude towards others , because too much negativity is bad for everyone . i  m not american btw , stop assuming , looks like it  s not for you .

7. i might have translated that wrong , it ' s a subject where you learn things like putting yourself on the market , filling out the paper work for your business and building your brand . marketing class is probably a better translation .

8. yes ! it ' s like i ' m waiting for the other shoe to drop so i get super anxious and sometimes even make things bad or trigger myself
   (ID: c8d3ed63eebd9001350e26c929407d3c3c1d3797)

9. i ' m pretty open to things like that so it doesn ' t bother me . but i feel yea it kinda sucks it doesn ' t go both ways . were you wearing anything specific ?
   (ID: 4d2bd95e298d7388cb5572690594217965d519a9)

10. i involved a physical action , like a weird interpretive dance move , to help me remember some things . it ' s weird , but it worked for me .

13. why isn ' t it cordless . if its for kids it should be cordless or have one of those easy disconnect things . kids like to jump around and try to move their avatar by moving themselves . seems to me that a lot of systems are going to come flying off tv stands with these controller

14. anime is a genre no different than a type of music , and yes it may have many subcategories like most things do . you can keep trying to justify your point though .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

15. it ' s kind of like trying to apply one moral standard to the entire world . different things are appropriate for different places .
   (ID: a28f00ba38e217547cc7dc092aa0183ed157e73d)

16. click the link . they can help direct you . it sounds like you are dealing with melancholy . there are things that can be done to help get you straight with how your feeling . do it .
   (ID: f0d54c46f5079e288aec33e8e202b31a47b7373f)

18. i would make some of his body parts be inactive or whatever and have a few of those probe things flying around it , like when you ' re fighting it .

19. this wouldn ' t happen if police departments screened their academy applicants for things like racism and misogyny . it would also help to hire applicants who are " too " smart instead of barring them automatically because of the level of their intelligence . predictably , judging by reaction to these proposals , asking for any of this is a direct attack on the police .

20. if you have trouble keeping on top of things perhaps buy a calendar from a store mark out specific tasks like say for example put down dusting  vacuuming every two weeks , changing out your sheets  pillowcases once a week etc etc . hang it on the back of your closet where you keep your vacuum and cleaning supplies . after a while you ' ll form new habits and can get rid of the calendar .
