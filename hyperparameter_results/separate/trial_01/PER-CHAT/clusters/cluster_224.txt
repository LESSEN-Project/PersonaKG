4. in the days where everyone wants access to free information , we have plenty of sites to provide that access . sites like documenting reality , liveleak , goregrish and best gore . they help preserve the legacy of what rotten was . it ' s not some sicko fetish like reddit seems to misinterpret . we want to be reminded of how bad the world can get , so we may appreciate our own lives and those of everyone else .

20. this might not be truth in history , but when caterina sforza ' s enemies captured some of her children and demanded that she surrendered in exchange for their freedom , she reportedly flashed her genitals and said something that ' s along the lines of  " do it , if you want to  hang them even in front of me . here i have what ' s needed to make others " or something like that . quote lifted from wikipedia . it sounds more badass in mario puzo ' s book , though .
