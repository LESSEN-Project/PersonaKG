Total from this dataset: 30

1. never understood being friends with exes , like if you broke up , there ' s obviously something not good between you both . why would it change just because you ' re not intimate . maybe a year later i ' d be alright with it , but saying " let ' s stay friends " is an almost bullshit excuse to not feel bad .

2. for someone that just got out of the shower and isn ' t dressed up , you still look very pretty . you have a natural beauty to you . plus you were a really good sport in roastme and are pretty funny . you ' re the type of woman that a guy can date and take around his friends . you seem like you could get along with the guys . i doubt you ' re actually that annoying .

3. i wanna get one and just hang it up in my closet until my parents see . then i  ll take it out of the closet , like me . ooh that  s a good idea .

4. yeah smoking and drinking is a really bad combo . i ' ve made that mistake but it just amounted in a bad trip not anything extreme like you tho . as long as you keep it separate it ' s all good tho .

5. it sounds cliche and like a instagram " quote " but being single is so much better than being in a relationship that ' s not healthy . you really have to see that you pretty much are in a relationship while you ' re technically single . that relationship is with yourself . that is the most important relationship you will ever have . no one else can " make " you happy . that ' s an internal job . everything else is just a bonus . good for you for leaving that behind .

6. great ! what other advice would you give to someone trying to find her meaning in life , not just values , i feel like i have a pretty good sense of my values , but what about finding meaning ?

7. compare his lifestyle to the previous one . the current pope is much more modest with his attire and seems to me like a genuinely good guy . it ' s a nice message and you are just hating so you can hate on religion . why do you care ?
   (ID: 4a03851d25b2526583af78261bff2af13796094e)

8. i feel like counseling would be a good thing , you ' ve been through a lot . maybe keep a journal to write down how you feel ? how do you guys communicate ? do you have a set method to communicate or do you just wing it ?

9. theres no way to tell from just bites . oftentimes , bed bug bites look like a rash and not actual bites . you only see a red bump , not the bite itself . keep checking . good luck !

10. sorry i totally disagree . it  s sad that morphine and oxycontin and fentanol are legal and good but heroin is the same thing just less processed but they demonize it because the money from it funds iraq and everybody in that region who makes it . it is evil unless we can tax it first like weed

11. they should either remove the tac or rework it . i would rather they rework it though , my idea is make it more for shooting further away just like the heavy shotgun .  another way it could work is for bonuses for getting those meaty body shots . hitting every shot on the body should do some good damage .   x200b  pump for headshots , tac for bodyshots . also it should replace the need for an smg  secondary weapon . it needs to be a viable option or it needs to be removed .

12. you  re probably already gone but i feel exactly the same about this , there  s no good memes here anymore , just the same old shit about how no caption means no instagram normies can understand and crap like that , i  m tired of it
   (ID: bc78626850b5b3cc09b69b593f8444252918ab69)

13. for me it ' s kinda like when i buy a vinyl record instead of just listening to the track online . it ' s irrational and douchey but feels sooooo good .
   (ID: b2abb1253d94645a61780bf97f30035ba7de31c6)

14. i ' m the third , walking dead isn ' t a horrible show at all , it ' s just has " filler  like " episodes that can be boring but when the good ones do come on its worth it .
   (ID: a73b0dda35d389b4f74e47db6574e0f71738b683)

15. i guess he isn ' t legit then . i suggest that you move on from him . maybe lose contact with him completely . but it ' s your choice on what you do . there ' s someone out there who will actually love you for who you are and not just for your body . if a pathetic person like myself can find love , then it ' s abolutely possible for you to find one . good luck !

16. m , i hope this is you . it sounds like you . or maybe we ' re just two strangers trying to find their person by sending messages to the void . good luck op . you ' re not alone .
   (ID: 3caade38cb82aa68e42f54daf07f2da555b9bd7d)

17. like with anything , just be as careful as you can afford to be . take pride in your gear and it ' ll serve you well . cases are a good idea but not essential  however , it ' s better to have one than not .
   (ID: e2865528dd17e86320ca523d3db462efa29e7ca7)

18. hey guys i would just like to thank you for commenting on this because its cool to see everyone ' s thoughts good or bad about their respective teams . with that said happy commenting .

19. fyi this is not at all related to me or anything i ' d do to myself . hopefully you posted that info for others that might be reading this , but this post was purely out of curiosity of those who have been in such a situation themselves . i ' m all good . i couldn ' t imagine doing something like that to myself for any reason . i was just shocked at what i saw , squeamishly so . glad to hear you are doing better . best of luck to you .

20. the worst part of the high is when you feel the comedown first starting to creep up on you . i always brace myself just like  shit . okay here we go .  sending good thoughts your way friend !
