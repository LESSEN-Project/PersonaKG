1. if they go to an area you ' re not expecting , use a random short quest you can find tonnes online that you can use to link them back on track onto the main quest also just remind them during session zero that this is your first time and to try not to go too out of their own way

4. i wouldn ' t call it embarrassing . it ' s just your truth . it is how you feel . the key is to understand exactly why you are crying and what you are holding on to . maybe get your thoughts about it down on paper so that you can see if they make sense . if your thoughts are very polarized , try to find the balance within them . you may not get closure from this , but i believe that you could get to a place you ' re comfortable with . a more actualized place . and then , you may be prepared to spend time with others should you so choose .

6. is it wrong to keep going on dates with someone you have no interest in and you ' re just doing it to past time ? asking for a friend
   (ID: 207835490dafd3f48e753ba6fe91515e71a38ad9)

7. damn dude . it  s just my grandparents , and then my aunt recently moved back in , and she works a full time job , which i find really strange .
   (ID: 0a0a0d2c0a4a7d7e34d48fc951306d86291eb577)

8. it ' s hard for me to not say the world just because of the interesting time mechanics and usefulness .
   (ID: a4a42a6d53536662b269ebde74eb2403fec82351)

9. a gentle ease in can actually work pretty well . i ' m introverted and trying to put myself in more outgoing situations . i ' ve found that entering a new situation can be tough but once there you laugh at wasting so much time getting there . but that ' s just me .
   (ID: 459fc596b29142804e71e80f5d9aedf7673e5d43)

10. genichiro was definitely a wall for me as well . when i finally landed that last deathblow i legitimately punched the air . everything just finally clicked . the satisfaction of hitting a parry at the perfect time , getting those hits in and wearing him down . that feeling is something special .

11. it will be ok and just imagine the relief when it ' s all over and in the past ! your doctor will not scold you for holding off on appointments , she will be happy you came in ! even if you have the worst case scenario , you will be in the right place , plus most cervical cancers are treatable when caught in time .

12. nothing fancy honestly . whatever ' s handy at the time . just regular glue works fine if you use the correct amount .
   (ID: db2795e3479f3abf3fd16c22a2bea9450ad82357)

13. thanks for looking into it . also , another person said it just takes a long time to be trusted , is that correct ?
   (ID: 300135134ef0a5dd5df44c4b49b60523d12c2849)

14. it depends if it is historical fiction make sure what you say is happening to the celebrities actually happened at the time . if it ' s modern day fiction just make sure that what you ' re saying is plausible as in no " paris hilton rode a horse shirtless with vladimir putin " kind of stuff .

15. the jackals will do what ever benefits them most at any given time , so they ' ll probably just stay out of it and try to sell to both sides .

16. well after the 5th time listening it in a row remember to close out spotify or what ever you use or just take it off your playlist for the day

17. fiftyfifty it was in the comments of something and usually i just read the links but this time i clicked it . some of the most fucked up shot i  ve ever seen
   (ID: dd822a04a6272645af1ac35c30aa9e5f7818cb6b)

18. call my teacher hitler . i was banned from that class forever . just meant more free time for me , so , whatever .
   (ID: 744ff0f58440fff53c82081282d7b62eae0a5c80)

19. i would advise you to consider long and hard before you start doing what you are describing . it is theft and regardless of how many colleagues are doing it if you get caught you can be fired for cause and expect to be denied unemployment . how much is your integrity worth ? i travel for work all the time and have faced similar ethical considerations and ultimately decided against it . it ' s just not worth the risk to me .
   (ID: 4e8469b3e3dd6d24b94c07a8c89b88ed07cdc712)

20. i just read it for the first time too . i showed my husband the picture of the outside of the boa eating an elephant and covered the words asked him what he thought it was . he said a snake or a camel . i found the perfect man
