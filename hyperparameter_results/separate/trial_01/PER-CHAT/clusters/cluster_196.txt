3. that would be cool but john snows dead so unless they got like a younger version and showed his bits at the end . then maybe just maybe it ' d work . i mean he ' s the doctor with the most interesting storyline . he fought in the great time war ffs i ' d love to see that

4. not the end of the world , but stuff like this is going to happen now and then . just be a bit more careful about where you  re biting next time .
   (ID: 7e155e58dbfbdb78d094711d4ddb65ae5ef94fba)

5. depends on the specifics of it , like how it  s transferred , where i am at the time , etc . worst case scenario , probably better to just off myself .
   (ID: c7c4d9e907fb5e67426beaf35fab05216fc4d354)

6. pretentious ? no , more like it ' s just a waste of time to explain the situation , and it wouldn ' t benefit in knowing .
   (ID: c3299baadf649c84fcd78990aa1e1edfccbe92ce)

7. ya it just so happens that as soon as it  s in  fashion  , everyone has those bodies . it  s either genetics , plastic surgery or you dedicate all your time to build muscle and eat right and even then your butt will never look like the girls in the photo . guess what , it  s not possible !
   (ID: f103398311655b227398091923c8afa67f7b6a54)

8. its not just this place that looks like this its every location unless it is a very unpopulated are . i landed here hoping the place would fully load by the time i landed , but you can see that didn  t work out for me
   (ID: f719aed7433b3a3e76a59131787519a05e376be5)

9. that just sounds like he ' s having a tough time as an adult or starting out as one . i have a feeling i ' m going to end mine sort bois
   (ID: a91bab5f0acf1c56a567010f74b21b6e17dea907)

10. your comment reminds me of that time a far  right website claimed harvey weinstein ' s behaviour was a result of him being jewish and thinking gentile women were his for the taking . complete bollocks just like what you ' re spouting now . there are creeps and perverts of all colours .
   (ID: 8260f82c24d2a4a134e92bf2fdcfc09a8eecf8fa)

11. i didn ' t like that calculator when i first saw it because i thought it was too complicated . i just used it when you posted it and i have to admit i was ignorant the first time and i found a perfect poison . thanks .
   (ID: 4fb4c908dc007a44b48b8cec1d046e112493c054)

12. well those pesky alonne knights are an easy backstab , what i like to do is just dodge one attack and circle around until it makes another attack and boom . and i guess you ' re not doing too much damage so i suggest raising your strength and vigor and one thing you must remember is to take one at a time otherwise you ' re in trouble . plus it ' s iron keep .
   (ID: 47352b7c554167e987713b843beb8bb44852ccda)

13. just like that time i fought mundine and yet he was the underdog . cause that totally makes fucking sense . edit  also , if qld are the underdogs , maybe someone should tell sportsbet , tomwaterhouse and tab that .
   (ID: bfc8295225b5407486c541c559eba216b2ac86cf)

14. yes i feel exactly the same ! and honestly being alone for awhile has helped me focus on therapy and healing . but to be completely frank , although i feel like it ' s helping me " get better " i have no doubt in my mind that these behaviors will just flare up again next time i ' m in a relationship , if ever
   (ID: c8d3ed63eebd9001350e26c929407d3c3c1d3797)

15. i remember it all seeming like bs . it ' s been awhile , but i followed it fairly closely at the time . i just didn ' t believe them . they knew dude had a screw loose , or at least that was the common consensus . why let your kid come over in the first place ? it was all a little too convenient , if you ask me .
   (ID: 63950631ccaa115ce1d0897d36a927c079ff6368)

16. i would go back in time to where i started to become depressed and tell myself that just because it feels like your alone doesn ' t mean you are . if i had realized this earlier i might be in a better place .
   (ID: bcba277499b6ef611080cad6d34ea14bd375ac8d)

17. that ' s not normal for us , the last time we were single you actually had to just walk up and say something like hey do you mind if we sit with you guys .
   (ID: 1bd02980b08b581bf66c53c11318ac7da265e8a9)

18. she might be faking the contentment just to make you feel worse . and yes , if you act like you moved there on your own , you can make memories with new friends and not regret the time . i hope it ' s a wonderful year for you !
   (ID: 013ad639238c556bcb968e1a8b8aa593f27a1830)

19. not to be rude or anything . i just like to ask if these kinds of art last a long time when displayed at room temperature ? great skills from the man btw . grinning  face
   (ID: da213bc92ca055fd7abf084a13e83605bd49e5b9)

20. thanks for explaining . i can understand employees wanting to get paid for the work they ' re doing , but that seems like a really harsh punishment for just a minute or two of time .
