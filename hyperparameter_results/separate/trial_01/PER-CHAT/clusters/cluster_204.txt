19. only problem is that the people who do stand up for their culture are bashed with bigotry , racism , and sexist terms because we want them to conform to everyone else even if it means them losing touch with their heritage . both sides see it as the other side but the truth is it  s both . when we align ourselves with a group because it resembles our own morals but doesn  t uphold them is when culture is lost
   (ID: 4019c48f947e2215682688643a274c27c22d093c)

20. depends on the people . some people i genuinely want to get something for , others i feel obligated . and since i usually fail to save up during the year , i usually shoot for the nicest thing in my price range that i deem appropriate for them . for instance , if i feel obligated to buy someone something but im not on the best terms with them , im not gonna woo them too much , because i dont want them go get the wrong impression .
