1. i just decided to go with a hirsch on amazon that was nearly digit  off . i would really like some kind of sailcloth in the future though .

2. i can see where you ' re coming from . but for me , thrillers are more tension  based . movies like the parallax view , the pelican brief , jennifer digit , the invitation are thrillers . they operate on a foundation of ambience and psychological torment . once more than one person gets hacked up , or a monsteghost  demon shows up , or someone gets their mouth sewn to another person ' s asshole , we are then in the realm of horror . that ' s just what i use for my own personal categorization parameters .

3. when these ideas are thought of the main thought process always should be balance , and then theme . you cant take the secondary effect and use it to bypass , in ex . digit if you could link earthquake , you would leap slam in , then auto attack for the mini shockwave then the tremor . this would not be superior in any way to just doing it manually , you cant have just the fissure effect as no one has attacked the ground yet . makes no sense thematically , what about whirling blades through an enemy and ground slam going off every enemy hit ? or leap slam linked to infernal blow to get the explosion effect aswell . spells will never trigger trigger gems , and that ' s cause there cast speed is independent of weapon speed , you can link a heavy hitting spell like arc , to say srs and have somewhere of digit arc casts a second , stupidly op . its balanced on weapon cause all weapons has a somewhat balanced crits per second , or attack speed which requires seperate scaling , getting full dps ice novas at the cast speed of gmp magma orb . broken as f    . chance to hit just makes it a better cast on crit . that combo is literally fork , but otherwise you now have a  digit proj gmp essentially from split , applying lightning arrows debuff and damage with no downside , tornado shot gives ice shot digit  pierce and damage on the return , fundamentally it will never work , you cant decide which parts of the skill to take , cant choose the on hi of lightning with the proj of gmp , why not the chain effect of lightning with the single target no element of split arrow for digit arrow that hits digit other and deals pathetic damage ? food for thought

4. it ' s not like you ' re even trying to communicate with the living . you ' re just trying to watch the match so you can get the digit at the end .

5. i ' m a small child again , like digit or digit , i ' m just doing my shit playing in the back yard , then out of fucking nowhere three dinosaurs are resurrected . but not just any dinos , the three from fucking power rangers dino thunder . they start eating shit and obviously since i ' m a small child in this dream i ' m powerless to stop them , and children can ' t run very fast what the fuck am i going to do if one decides to eat me . and obviously power rangers aren ' t real so none of them every show up . so here i am trying to find some place to hide from these rampaging dinos when suddenly one spots me usually the pteranodon and the last fucking thing i see before i wake up is that fucker staring at me like a hungry bird .

8. actually , at one point this night it ' s digit o ' clock now it was pretty much like that as well because the hosts ' internet just dropped off and we weren ' t prepared for that . gonna tell a funny story of tonight later in gaming

9. is there one of these for the extra deck ? sometimes i feel like digit cards is just one to few , and theres so much nuance in deciding how many copies to run in the extra .
   (ID: 46f455b780faca36116964131a4d0622c465bf7f)

10. i ' m a big supporter of eugenics , but not in the digit ' s racisty way i would just like to see genetic diseases removed from our species .
   (ID: 94405664876a7b3c5d61ce1dccf6922e88089588)

11. the more likely possibility is integration . at some point we ' ll just implant the technology into our bodies and control it with our minds . ever watched ghost in the shell ? i strongly believe that what that show depicts isn ' t too far off from what reality will look like in about digit years or so .

12. squishy is a childhood nickname that i had all my life . it ' s based of the jellyfish from finding nemo . when i was setting up a gaming blog i felt like i needed something more than just squishy . so i randomly thought of squishy pixels . pixels came from a joke i made back in digit when i wanted to keep my surname secret from a youtuber in tomodachi life . i used that for a month until i realised that there was an app company with the same name so i simply changed pixels to pixelz . i ' ve had that name for two years .

13. i feel like ever since digit took over everything halo has severely dropped in quality apparently that includes text on a box which would be so easy to spot and cheap to fix that they just really must not give a shit anymore

14. my mom once walked in my room while i was watching anal and in a panic i tried to pause it but instead turned the volume up by like digit notches . i managed to pause it but only just and some how not in trouble . also this was on her phone to .
   (ID: 7da77d27f88bf1f61217e0ac91e9049e57a7e29d)

15. they should revert e and make it so it has like a digit  ratio for ad and ap then up its base significantly early and make it a bit lower later on . his early power wasnt just from his q but his e also hurt a bit more i believe .
   (ID: 3428085717e0932776c3970e7f1d3a8e80b23c29)

16. i ' ll watch the first digit episodes with the rewatch . if i like it , i ' ll just watch it on my own .
   (ID: 622ae5e8e0ffe2c066a3d94dcee004b5696643bb)

17. the problem is that she doesn ' t like the digit  3k options and she will have to wear it forever . she probably doesn ' t like them for aesthetic reasons . you can find a compromise . ask her for the features she needs in a ring and find a non diamond option , that looks the same or better and costs a lot less probably less than  digit . if she is not ok with that , then that is a serious lack of compromise on her part . alternatively , i ' d just buy the 10k ring but only if you are comfortable with it .

18. about digit seconds , because that  s how long the apocalypse would last with the military and army and stuff . if it got worse , i would just be like ,  fine , i  ll do it myself ,  and snap my fingers . then all the zombies turn to dust .

19. i was born with something called microtia type digit . if you search it up you will understand , it is not gross it just looks like a bunch of extra skin and bone
   (ID: 06f1a2f5d32f7dd1949254b41bf285307f38a718)

20. you gave to quit before the battle packs are distributed . as soon as a match ends just watch the bottom left corner , the quit icon should be there for like digit seconds .
