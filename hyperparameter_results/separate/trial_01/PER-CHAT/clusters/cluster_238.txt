   (ID: ea433c141ef76ae553e587f0d75875fdcacd7a90)

2. obvs , i ' m not speaking for every fan . it just that the most vocal fans are always the most controversial . sort by controversial in the most recent chapter . i agree , most of us dont want deku ' s dad to be related to a villian , but that doesn ' t stop the dissent fans from spreading their message . i ' m sure if you search , " deku ' s dad theory " , it wont be what if he ' s just a regular dude that breath ' s fire .

4. i can sympathise with your boyfriend , because i was very similar . ultimately , its a bit tricky . it ' s very hard to get someone to try different foods unless they actively want to . one thing that you could try is pushing it back onto him . have you tried asking him to plan some meals that are within budget ? he might stretch further if he sees the benefits instead of it just being you force feeding him something new

14. this sometimes just happens due to human error . they will want the money back , it  ll be obvious when they do their review prior to figuring out how much to collect back from the other driver . you can come forward now or wait for them to call you . my company often lets our customers simply pay us back over the phone with a credit card , or send in a check . and no , we cannot just add it onto the insurance renewal bill . thank you for noticing ! we all love honesty !

15. the threat does not need to be fatal . it just merely has to be something someone doesn ' t want to deal with . but yes , it is a robbery , forcing someone to give you something under duress
   (ID: 8360c6d04ba11da7a727532482d78505e52a4150)

17. they are . you clearly haven ' t researched this if you believe this . you can ' t just tell yourself what you want to hear and assume everything that contradicts that is false . try doing some objective research instead of butting your personal beliefs into a conversation as if they are fact .

18. yta you come off as an ungrateful leach and when they told you " hey this is how we do it here , its polite and shows respect , and we will still pay for it " you decide you ' re better than their culture and just refuse to be a part of anything they want to include you in . i can understand why they would be upset with you
   (ID: c4dd014917cb9f6657eb79179ac09bf821575d80)

19. the way i look at it is not the number of doors , but whether you ' ve got access to what you want access to . from that perspective , i ' d be more inclined to ask someone selling me a house why i dont have a door to the large backyard before i asked why there were four exterior doors . just my two cents . hope that helps .

20. have you ever worked sales floor ? because if another sales floor associate told me that i was retarted for doing this i would be offended . why ? because this is literally my job . my job is to show them what ' s possible and that ' s what they are doing . so , understanding that this is how they do their job and basically calling it retarted is what ' s messed up . i was just pointing out that it was harsh terminology . you justify yourself on whatever you want though buddy . thanks for blowing everything out of proportion for no reason . i see why you ' re merch .
