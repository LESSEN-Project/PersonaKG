1. to me personally , art is a useful method to show someone a different perspective than the one that ' s considered " norm " a good way to achieve this is to adopt a sort of surrealistic lens . some art can be weird , bizarre , and provocative . but that ' s the best part of it . the weirdness makes you think .

2. are you looking for critique ? i personally think it ' s good . anyone can nitpick details they might have drawn different or in my case , not , no drawing skills .

3. i think recovery and mmlp2 could have been shorter but otherwise i agree . the only problem with this one is that idk if the title track would be a good way to end it

5. not at all when you consider how much better the songs from emotion and dedicated are . so good that there ' s only one song from kiss cmm . i think its a no brainer that she leave out tug of war completely .

7. actually , now that you mention it , my pill is now under a different name and i changed a few weeks before i noticed my hair falling out . i have all of those symptoms as well . especially the depression , that really caught me off guard . i think i ' ll still go to my doctor and ask her opinion . thank you so much for sharing your story ! i ' ve been wanting to get off the pill and this may be a good excuse .

8. this is why i prefer starting the season on an away game . less pressure on andy . dude is not feeling it right now , i think it ' ll flip around at the half . hopefully . the plays are there to be made which is a good sign at least .

9. probably tell them the same thing you posted here . i think inclement weather should be a good enough excuse .
   (ID: 6c138f795d624fa7a35359fd23a18fc7e16efba8)

10. i think it would be a good idea for each person to have their own cast of characters , and we all write in the same universe with some preset ground  rules basically . it was only ever meant to be something casual and fun .

11. actually mine is a really cool dude , he remembers shit i ' ve said to him a year ago , i think that ' s a really good value . as for you op , you are not bound to one specific therapist , you try to look for other ones .

12. i ' m glad that they moved away from that . i think the floating words thing is used way too much in tv now . the first two examples that come to mind are sherlock and the good doctor .

13. one of these days i ' m going to write the stupid book so i can ' t tell you , but i think it ' s good .
   (ID: 4f8623948722fc7bb449dc0c54c03ba78cae5c43)

14. how i wasn ' t smart enough to avoid the mistakes i made at work . how i shouldn ' t of asked so many dumb questions at work . my long lasting realization that i may in fact be a dipshit . my realization that i am not as good as i think i am .
   (ID: c11592c54f6061d979d11af92c6289790a5bec93)

15. watch tv browse social media and i think about everything litteraly everything the good , the bad , the past , the future , shit that makes no sense , all of it .

16. good thing your kids are  indoctrinated  to be accepting . i think it  s your turn lady

17. i think  good  is subjective . however , you should mention the area you are talking about in your original post  in my opinion .

18. the button may be sticking it could be something underneath that ' s causing it . if you think it could be this , check out some youtube videos on how to take it a part . i had a trigger that kept sticking and once i took it a part and cleaned it , it was as good as new .

19. it ' s been pretty good . i think i ' m about to head to bed soon though . how has yours been ?

20. i guess portals are not that rare . i think they are gateways to the worlds with complex life . if planets of complex life forms are as rare as the sean said then portals are good bait for players . they will encourage players to explore more . and even if they can ' t find good proper planets with beautiful vegetations , portal will be there always to give a glimpse of the beauty you can ' t find on your own . but it ' s reminds that it ' s there
