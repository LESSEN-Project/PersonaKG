1. get a smart , cut off the abs sensor and go with that . if you can drift that 70hp go cart , you ' ll know you ' re good . and you ' ll become a legend . everyone will look and laugh at you for being the one kid drifting in a smart but you ' ll flash way more than if you got a 240sx . only down point is that you ' ll be driving a contraceptive but those sick drifting skillz will compensate .
