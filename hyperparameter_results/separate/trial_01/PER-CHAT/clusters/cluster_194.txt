1. driving is the worst thing i think i have to experience every day . i despise the fact that for some reason people still cannot figure out the rules of the road . what makes it so much better is when you clearly follow some rule and then they scream at you . like " oh i ' m soooooooo sorry i didn ' t stop so you could drive straight through your yield sign . my bad "

2. not really weird but i think about how the world isn ' t always watching . and how i can rarely be the highlight of someone else ' s day or week or whatever . like if i embarrass myself , make a mistake , be as awkward as i can , people would soon forget cause of how preoccupied they are about their own lives . also , controlled breathing while muttering " all is well " or " you ' re okay " usually calm me down .

3. set goals and achieve them . example if you hated your hairstyle and you always wanted a nice cut , make that a goal to go out and get a cut you like . do small goals to improve yourself to fufill what you ' ve always wanted . stop listening to others and learn to not give a shit because out of the thousand faces you see per day , you won ' t ever see them again . so it doesn ' t matter what people think .

4. i ' m not neutral so probably shouldn ' t be answering . although i think that being neutral is the best place to be when it comes to politics . being over invested in something like politics , in which the majority of people have no control is bad for the heart mind and soul .

5. i think you  re right . i  m pretty sure that head was made by one fur all , and artie has a suit from them . i  ve noticed a number of one fur all suiters involved in murrsuiting , so i wonder if they  re willing to add those sphs for people commissioning them . regardless , i like the style of one fur all suits and can see why they  re popular .

6. i ' m a huge advocate for gun ownership on the grounds of self  defense . hell i even tell people i train martial arts that if they are really concerned about their safety they should buy a gun . despite all of that . i think the stand  your  ground laws in places like florida are fucking ridiculous .

7. she sounds like a particularly funky green hag . she could use some kind of ritual , spell , potion , whatever fits your plot , to turn people into lycanthropes , but i think it would be interesting if you made the lycanthropes that come from her more feral than the regular ones .

8. oh okay , yeah i can see what you mean there but i think that there are more people then me that post stuff like this on here anyway . you never answered what makes me an attention seeking whore from this ?
   (ID: 74b41b40662f8290cb9efa13620a4b8ecd792ba9)

9. what do you mean folks like me ? folks who work ? almost everybody ends up working . everybody works . why do you think you belong to a category of people suddenly

10. i think it  s because anime is so associated with porn and waifus  waifu pillows and stuff like that . at least that  s what i understand from people i  ve talked to about it .
   (ID: 21913bbb6fa90e9386b8ffe22ff8b944d1307742)

11. i think its unrealistic to police something like this . i do believe that there ' s a lot of people out there who aren ' t fit to be parents that probably should be sterilized but that ' s another argument lol
   (ID: b489bebca81ea07c422e4a78e54cd162edf2a814)

12. you got to stop and think of your question  how one can get prepared for being a president ? ronald reagan ? pinochet ? lenin ? mao ? cesar ? clinton ? funny , right ? so here you go  most people in power are opportunist , including the greatests like franklin or lincoln . i hope you understand futility of your enquiry . however , there is a possibility that you are a concealed troll .

13. i wish my answer was no but probably yes . there ' s still a large population of people in the u . s . that still believes places like fox news and breitbart are legitimate news sources and think trump is doing a great job .

14. combat vet here , afghanistan . fireworks used to bother me more than they do now , but when someone throws a quarter stick or something into the middle of the street at 4am , it still scares the shit out of me , but i think thats probably normal . loud sudden noises probably make most people uncomfortable . i ' m still not a fan of the ones that whistle though , they sound too much like rockets .

15. it isn ' t . political correctness is for pussies . political correctness doesn ' t help anyone . only bigots are politically correct , because they think they are helping those that they are treating like babies . source  i ' m a black guy that can ' t stand that shit . either i can make it or i can ' t , on my own merits . there are people that would discount me for my race , but that is their loss in skill , and i will make then and their choices look dumb when i go to a competitor and body them .

16. i ' d like to think that . and i do tell myself ' well , at least you ' re not boring ' , but sometimes it ' s hard to deny that people find you weird , and not in an endearing way . such as when they wait until you ' re out of hearing range and tell someone else , who then tells you later on .
   (ID: 228e4bc3f39aec9ef98403004cf1a66070777182)

17. join both bank accounts and keep one pot of money for both people . i ' m fine with a shared pot , but i think it ' s really important to have independent spending money as well . if i work overtime , i ' d like to feel some of the benefits .
   (ID: 63154ff41b9bf398d80398dfc8830bc3a80a6641)

18. hell look at star trek , it ' s like a communist  utopian society . no money , no needs or wants , only people striving to better themselves and where personal glory has nothing to do with how much capital you can horde . but hey , most americans apparently think that ' s evil .
   (ID: e84a0c717951970f66d3290d462f6e0a5040f671)

19. i disagree . what makes something a " fact " is that it has been scientifically proven to be correct , and is backed with peer  reviewed evidence . facts change only when new information is presented that follows the same criteria . we should always stress to people the importance of basing their opinions on these principles , otherwise we are complacent in the dumbing down of society . but i agree that dogma is a huge pain the ass that i ' ve learned to ignore . sometimes the argument is not worth the effort , no matter how infuriating . i think i read somewhere that it ' s like playing a game of chess with a pidgeon  all the pidgeon is goin to do is knock down the pieces and shit on the board , then strut around like they ' ve won .

20. in a way we all think we are the underdog man . the problem is kind of that some other bloke thinks people who like generic superhero movies are the underdog to the cultural elite and projects that onto you , even if you may have other stuff in common .
