1. i know i ' m going to get downvoted like hell , but why use a small lighter ? i never understood why people do that .
   (ID: e978c4c5dd931b8985b65369abe1ef855c833aa3)

2. i feel like i have to drag myself to work especially if i know that i  ll be dealing with a bunch of people , especially new hires . but of course , it  s also rewarding and fulfilling knowing that you  ve addressed employees  concerns .
   (ID: 37a53f57c1e81fd7d11d07f35e10864f195674b4)

3. i know some people wear their watches like this as it is less likely to ding against surfaces when the face is in the inside of your wrist . not sure if this is ops reasoning .
   (ID: de1936095bbf9ac762b5f2bd9654b6a8ab94d032)

4. you are holding on to the actions themselves instead of the intentions behind them ! like i literally said  if the intent of teabagging was not to piss someone off noone would give a shit ! you can buy a knife and noone will care , but if you use that knife to stab someone people will ! i know this is a really stupid comparision but i hope that that gets into your head ! the issue is not the action , but the intent behind it !
   (ID: f00497cab5e262ea00a022394dce818ebb6c623b)

5. and the only reason we do is because of our absentee mods . you know that the fact that i can post here makes people froth at the mouth and i would be banned almost immediately like i am from most other canadian subs .
   (ID: 24bccbf5956c17ad493afaca1dced8dd5090f865)

6. to everyone who thinks this does not qualify for foodporn . what makes you the expert ? you know how there ' s sexporn of all kinds ? now imagine that same idea for foodporn . you may not like amateur fudge packing but some people do . i ' ll concede the title is a bit off though .
   (ID: 033f2c18bf4595efe99c78c096a0b763ff7f2eb3)

7. the real person your making up rape stories about should know so they can kick your fucking ass . shitty people like you are the reason no one believes rape victims . i  d rock your shit rn if i could .
   (ID: c502154cdae9232a9351bdc0e55d2030d75a8094)

8. a nazi slaughtered jews in their shul and you ' re more concerned about the words of a " fake orthodox " jew criticizing the rabbinate . if he was as immutable and powerful as you believed , you wouldn ' t be complaining about this . if i ' m a nobody with a flawed perspective , you should try treating me like that instead of debating me like i was one of the sages . you know why it bothers you ? because deep down inside , way in the kishkas , you know there ' s a truth to it . it lingers and you can ' t really get it out . treat people nicer and remember that every jew is a jew , even if they aren ' t perfect .
   (ID: 989f324bab72cf1bf4a29235fe4deca25845ca1c)

9. i know but when people contsaly keep pushing in to have something with someone like that is going to solve any problem or you are lesser human being for not being in relationship , can get tiresome .
   (ID: be4c274bc118fc65202a843b71f43c10798b6eb9)

10. they do miss a lot of stuff but they also catch quite a few guns . unless they personally go through every bag stuff will be missed . the way i see it the tsa is like a masterlock , easy to get through if you know even a little about what your doing but will deter most people with malicious intent .
   (ID: 8764362ad6045d7b3d1a7f5e41433a658be41854)

11. like i said i never went on vacation by myself , so i dont know if x country is cheaper than y . so if the kind people of reddit can point me in right direction , that would be great
   (ID: b4fb8e20516a28baa38075931e9715db2375a956)

12. shit that doesn ' t apply to me . like i know that there are other people in the world that the question applies to , but why the fuck are you asking a question to tow truckers only !
   (ID: 661cbd631caa9db4ab702976879371243802e35e)

13. because they ' re both stupid in different ways when someone is speeding they ' re an idiot because they are putting other people ' s well being at higher risk and when someone is going slow they ' re being a moron because it ' s like , do you not know how to read the speed limit sign ?
   (ID: 2a4624d0a857c0f5c74b1ae12bfbc02b65eb5b73)

   (ID: 354f69f9c6cf00a975f2f112bc11eaa79f843f63)

16. i would like to know the formal explanation , thanks . it seems like the reason people are having many registration issue is because the aiming reticle isn ' t an accurate depiction of what is happening and is causing serious issues . it doesn ' t light up red when it should and it does light up when it shouldn ' t and this is causing a lot of problems for many people . it makes more sense and more balance sense for the bullets to come out of the barrel during blindfire but from the center of the screen when aiming the gun .
   (ID: 6088dd0baee0a896df3f6dce7425bdbaaafc2486)

17. some people are a lot like clouds , you know . life  s so much bright once they  re gone .   some bmth song off their new trash album .
   (ID: a934d5bdd462e197a6ebc0b85e935b30eb73b928)

18. i judge wealthy rich people because i feel that their lives are easier and they will never know what it ' s like to struggle when really i have no idea of the struggles they ' ve been through or are going no through .
   (ID: e8c228e1e7bfe50c86317e9062b93dcbe0951b39)

19. well i used to laugh at  tendies because i honestly thought it was a joke , then i met one irl and it ' s not fun anymore now that i know people like that actually exist
   (ID: 57ed0f8209fe46001f705b8c44476862b098f01f)

20. you ' re welcome , mate , it is all my pleasure . as i said before , you should post to mechanicalkeyboards in the future because it is full of people like me that actually know what they are talking about . if you have any more concerns , feel free to ask me
