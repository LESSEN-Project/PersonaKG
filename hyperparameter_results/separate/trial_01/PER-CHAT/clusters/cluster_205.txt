15. because the heat of the sun , and the amount of water and salt and all the time that it ' s been there . there is more water and more area affected by that than in your glass of water . although maybe it ' s an interesting experiment if you put lot of salt in a small container , you heat it up and when you ' re gonna smell it , you cover you head and the container with a towel . if you try it , let me know what happens .
   (ID: 2069df24de0e78e4765ca507edb903ca074ac2d8)

17. that was surprisingly well put . thanks for explaining it so nicely . i ' m not being sarcastic you have a nice day too . i know what separates our views now is simply that i believe in the bible and that no foul word should empty one ' s mouth , but since you ' re not a christian , i ' m not going to force that on you . i guess time for us to respectfully part ways . been a pleasure hearing points from the other side .
