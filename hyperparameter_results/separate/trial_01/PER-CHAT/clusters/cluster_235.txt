1. despicable me . it made me question why people would rather spend time creating a movie on such spawns of satan when the world has so many problems as it is
   (ID: 3111867455454a24ad021d9baccb67003b042cd0)

2. same old corrupt blokes get elected every fucking time no matter how much people complain and claim they ' ve voted for someone else .
   (ID: 32520dc340c18ed101e3d5ea02b3a7bca25dcc29)

3. first time seeing rocky horror picture show . i knew vaguely that some people dressed up , brought props , etc , but had no idea how wild it would be .
   (ID: f65df7567f1176928c5dd93958c309858d860fb8)

4. granted . every time people on youtube fight you can instantly tell if people are being honest or not . the first time you notice this , it happens when you are in a conversation with your significant other about whether or not they  ve been faithful . you instantly are able to tell they have not been honest with you .

5. old av is fun one time . once people figure it out it becomes the same 40v40 run past eachother and race to the final boss . even when korrak is a thing , no one ever does it .
   (ID: 2e7b8231d6052f12afa017d28c152ee913491791)

6. i still use " merry solstice ! " since half the people on the planet haven ' t a clue what the word means , they look at me as if i said something in greek . makes me smile every time , and i ' m never really wrong .
   (ID: 5ee4d4a98d2da62835d0e63abf8fe5bbfa95111b)

7. there  s no reason for feeling bad because you miss a day of exercising . almost no one you see at the gym sticks to a workout plan all the time . simply because of the fact that you exercise at all , you  re already doing more than a lot of other people and even exercising one day a week already makes a huge difference
   (ID: ffc22c7d073a18af8b2e5d9225096634b636af9a)

8. it makes sense though , if i were an immortal time traveler i ' d mess with people by doing that too .
   (ID: f2eafcb4d8e0b098ec90234d0bc310dcc0e2a189)

9. i would hesitate to label myself as " asexual " graysexual , maybe ? but growing up i do recall feeling confused when my peers talked about looking at nude pictures and getting turned on by them . it took some time for me to understand , at least on an intellectual level , where they were coming from , in that people actually get turned on by that .
   (ID: ed0b13c564453126096abe31f65a68ee14386c50)

10. i get so damn annoyed when people criticize me for looking up everything . " you are taking all of the mystery and wonder out of life " gods dammit , no ! if you are wondering about mysteries that humanity has already solved , you ' re doing it wrong . when you look up information and can ' t an answer to your question , that is what you should spend your time wondering about .
   (ID: 7e67f2109db2f138225338a090de78cfd116cfca)

11. even worse , he also ruined the swastika . it has been used for thousands of years in art , but nobody uses it anymore because of him . my dad does historical reenactments , and some of his stuff or his friends ' stuff has swastikas on them . people get really offended even though they ' re not looking at the context of the time period it ' s from .
   (ID: 82f6afecf5df3f69d84c7367b7ca206c3a5d282f)

12. you  re misinterpreting my response . yes , it  s horrible that they killed someone . a life in prison is bad . but killing the murderer won  t bring them back , and people that are in jail for a very long time can have a change of heart and realize that they fucked up . you  re talking about another human being .
   (ID: 4ad6bb3e49af731f30a5ddaeb2cb05131c11740a)

13. i tried to have a break with my now ex and that ' s probably what made me realise i had to end it . we agreed not to talk to each other for three days and not to be seeing other people , but she would not leave me alone the entire time .
   (ID: d1ba646c70874b80aeff9ce914be506ab334920a)

14. spend more time with the people you love . they can help you in tough times .
   (ID: 72ffe7e6d3740aadaadd4805db5d160d12ec4470)

15. do people count as objects ? cos i ' d have my gf turn invisible . naked all the time chilling round the house . you feel your way through the dark and whoops that ' s a tiddy . its perfection .
   (ID: f6b8978c4b660719e17dff38ba86c988b9bf86f5)

16. at work i get people to apply for credit cards that are horrible and have no benefits . you lose money when you use them because of the interest . i feel bad every time .
   (ID: d7d8c7d16055bd0ef900d84c651fa82c9205e05b)

17. i ' d slip everyone some laxatives around a particular area so they all get the shits , then watch them try to explain it as an outbreak . then gradually , each day , do it to more people . over time , they will be a new " pandemic " but with no discoverable pathogen !
   (ID: bb70c8a6d45cb154f3b33ce5b3fb81e5c1439433)

18. i see crazy ass homeless people or crackheads all the time but some dude sticking his dick out is better than a earthquake or asteroid
   (ID: 701f8001d10c04dcd53d9b13ab2a896b452e50f7)

19. becomes irritable with your presence and  or easily annoyed with everything that you do or say but is completely fine with other people . most of the time , a person falls out of love for someone when they  re in love with someone else . so another would be when he  she unconsciously talks about the other person to you or to his  her friends .
   (ID: 0c0a6550f9275bda2b6c87bb0ec8270ad1517dbd)

20. i believe everyone has the ability to change for better or worse , the problem is they usually lean towards being worse in my case , after the 50th time being fucked over by people who i should be able to trust , you sort of stop altogether .
