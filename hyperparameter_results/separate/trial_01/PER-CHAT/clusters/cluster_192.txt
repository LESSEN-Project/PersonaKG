1. i don ' t know if this is really qol but maybe you could add a kill cam to the crucible once you die rather than staring at your ghost . there have been so many times where i have wondered how somebody had killed me from a certain angle or something like that . it would be nice to see it from their perspective .

2. i don ' t know , but that ' s more of a philosophical question . maybe you could say an earthquake hit you by chance , because humans didn ' t make it happen . but calling the outcome of other humans ' decisions " chance " does not fit the word . like , " i didn ' t vote , so trump became president by chance "

3. fuck your an idiot . " blatant transphobia ! i love your argument though . " your not listening so your transphobic . i know what they stand for . i don ' t need lessons from a dumb fuck like you .

4. thank you . i try to be fairly reasonable and moderate and respectful as much as possible , although i certainly admit sometimes i have lost my cool . i don ' t know anything about you , but i ' d like to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you ' re a fine person as well .

5. i don  t know what ' playing safe ' in pointless means anyway . it  s like you said  a lack of guts or intelligence , or going for something that will score highly because everyone else knows it .

6. as a new member of punpatrol i haven ' t much experience with policy so i don ' t know the rule on that . i feel like you should be allowed to make jokes on joke subs

7. my main concern is that you don ' t know who else this woman treats like this . you may not be the only one she bullies . it ' s definitely not your duty to stand up to her , but standing up to her and explaining what ' s wrong may help somebody else .

8. here ' s the other one that they ' re referring to . funny how they get smashed like this . i ' m sure there ' s someone making these somewhere who takes pride in this . sorry , don ' t know how to link on mobile .

10. well , i doubt even rockstar knows what it will be about , but your idea is quite great . however , i really have a heart for the specific part of redemption , so i would like to see another character whose path to redemption we get to see , and dutch or hosea we already know they don ' t exactly do .

12. i don ' t know much as a canadian . but from one perspective it sounds like a huge mistake , and i ' m glad that we are no longer under british rule . from the other perspective , it could be great for them . either way , with this , the imminent change of monarchs , trump and growing worldwide trend in far right conservatism . the world economy is about to be flushed right down the toilet . we ' re all fucked .

13. what the heck ? that shouldn  t be allowed that he put you alone on your first shift . everyone is new at one point and when you  re new you obviously don  t know what to do ? that  s what training is for . you dodged a bullet there because most jobs would not be like that .

   (ID: 29f64c7d25f723b96a3046a7a98c5cfb0af49533)

15. i hate the word pretty as well . giving the fact that i don ' t know whether i ' m even attractive or not , i can ' t help but feel annoyed when other women call themselves that . like how do they get such confidence ?
   (ID: 605c2b528ab98551c59f0f81fa7b8045077c096c)

16. i see nothing wrong with free donuts cause you don  t have to take one . whereas in this situation they keep pestering me expecting me to change my mind . like i  m not stupid , you know ?
   (ID: 903829fb4aefc18f9ba3e0dc7d2f3267adf2bcc8)

17. here ' s a dumb question that ' s totally off topic . and i promise , i ' ve tried to figure this out myself before and i jut can ' t . but , what exactly , is pansexual ? because anyone that ' s ever explained it to me explains it in such a way , that it sounds like bisexuality . fact  i first heard of this word on okcupid , and this is the sentence . " i am pansexual . if you don ' t know what that means , look it up . if you ' re uncomfortable with it , you can fuck off and die ! that ' s all .

18. i start floating when i notice and that  s how i wake up . best way to control it is to start swinging like spider man but the scary part is that i don  t know what lies ahead , sometimes i end up in a different dream
