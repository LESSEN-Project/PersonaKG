5. there is an idea of a me  some kind of abstraction . but there is no real me  only an entity , something illusory . and though i can hide my cold gaze , and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable . i simply am not there . while i have all the characteristics of a human being  blood , flesh , skin , hair  but not a single , clear , identifiable emotion , except for greed and disgust . something horrible is happening inside of me . i think my mask of sanity is about to slip .

15. i ' m surprised why no one is mentioning the zhao ' s side thinking after this day infact after gaku ' ei was glaived by shin . we didn ' t see the reactions  thoughts of riboku . what is he thinking after ousen ' s actions or lack of actions . even in this chapter we didn ' t see any comments from other zhao generals on the right field . i think hara is intentionally not showing us the zhao ' s riboku ' s side of things as to give a big surprise at once .
