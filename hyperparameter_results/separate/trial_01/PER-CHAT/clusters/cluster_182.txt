1. yes , xhaka needs to go . and , yes , someone must take the blame finally . because with that kind of attitude we would have been sparred at least of some of those pathetic blunders . make a blunder like that just because you are not fully concentrated and you will be dropped . period . they know everything is fine whatever they do and that is mental edge our players are lacking for years and years .

2. just general knowledge you might like to know about a person unless your appearance makes you look youngeolder than you actually are

3. the thing about hill is that he isn ' t fast at the expense of being strong like someone like tavon austin is . i know this is high high praise and it ' s an absolute best case scenario but on some deep balls he reminded me of steve smith where he would fight for contested balls in spite of his size . i ' m not saying that he ' s about to be a wr1 , i am a chiefs fan and i ' m just offering a little insight into doubts about his size .

4. yeah but if this was me and op sounds just like my husband any sucking up presents or behaviour i would detest , because i have ' forced ' him to do it and know it ' s not coming from a place of love .
   (ID: 0754abce96e7ea9fd8cd1fd9efebfdaf70578d39)

5. then they know not to do that ? how am i supposed to have that to information until you just told me lol . even then most places have a little tip kind of tin  cup for situations like this in my city  region .

6. you know what ? just give her a tank , a straight up trigger tank that uses continuous bagworm  sheild  chameleon , it moves by scorpion  raygust that can easily be changed from legs to treads or even fins , hound minigun turrets and an ibis barrel , drops meteor mines like mario kart banana skins , lol and even throw in geist for uber carnage . chika does not even need to be the pilot , she can just be the battery and let someone else take care of the raw destruction , i ' m pretty sure shiori or yotaro would love to drive it round like an rc .

7. i beg to differ , i am a nice guy that is just who i am . maybe thats why girls dont like me because i dont know how to act mean or be a jerk to them .

8. sorry but i know nothing about modding . do rtdl emulations exist already ? and if so are they laggy like you said ? or is it just laggy when trying to mod ? anyway , keep up the cool work !

9. i know what you mean . as i said you really have to be disciplined when flying this plane . one false movement and you are dead . i somehow find it enjoyable . i just like the look of it and what its capable of but it is not an easy plane to fly by any means .

10. ok that makes more sense . i was picturing like an elementary aged kid literally just walking out with no explanation to the teacher . yes , i believe going to the bathroom should be more of a " hey , just letting you know i ' m going " kinda thing instead of asking for permission which i feel is how my first comment came across ?

11. just so you know , fairy tail is not well recieved by the majority of this subreddit so for your own wellbeing it ' s better to write answers like this as an opinion rather than a fact . edit  it ' s better to phrase all answers like that but especially ones about shows the sub dislikes

12. i ' ve cheated while drunk . it ' s not a fun thing to wake up to . it happens . but everyone is different . they have different brains , alcohol tolerance etc . i ' m just bad at impulse control , and know i ' m doing wrong as i do it , but cant bring my self to physically say no . btw i quit drinking everyone is different you cant expect everyone to act the same . it ' s like asking why everyone isnt a violent drunk , or giddy drunk , or sobbing mess drunk .

13. didn  t know about this i just found the screen on twitter and censored it a bit not fully because i  m god  s mistake and post it here because i felt like it belonged here sorry for my bad english

14. my friend and i do this thing where we just call each other dumb or the worst for no reason . we ' ll do it during class without even looking up from our books . me   name  you suck her  you ' re worse me  you ' re the worst her  you ' re the worstest me  not a word her  like you ' d know
   (ID: 92432ea050f3d4129309d7e77e204cce21dc7525)

15. i moved to a new city and it was lonely for a while . but the truth is there are plenty of frens . you just need to know where to look . go to meet ups or join a group that does something you like . ask work frens out occasionally . keep in contact with and invite old frens to hang out . you can do it .

16. so you know a lot of hard working non  college educated girls and agree ? but can ' t date them even though they ' re smart and hard working ? hmm . there is never anything wrong with wanting to care about how you look and portray yourself . just sounds like you make a lot of wrong assumptions about girls .

17. bro i know this sounds like i am just bragging but i predicted solari also . come on . with all the nonsense they say they guess something for sure
   (ID: bd4a2272f70fc28a12f6d3327c76ba398ff0d19d)

18. that ' s what i feel like makes it great , though . you have to know who you take in and ask how beneficial they are to your community as opposed to just bringing in sandbaggers . will dos mef carry his weight ? does sarol cutton bring anything to the table ? why should you bring rill wokos back to your home ?
   (ID: a85910e837bd841373d8a7b2a84f1bff22807d9e)

19. op , just letting you know , i ' ve been inside of many like you . hope you weren ' t related .

20. oh yeah , china ' s really trustworthy about this stuff . they would never lie about being environmentally friendly , it ' s not like their cities have the most smog and pollution in the world . yes i know they are trying strategies to fix that , but still . also how , how will you just stop an entire industry .
