   (ID: 01503a38757a34e914ff8d579bce4ba7d2ec39b2)

2. if you need people to care about you before you decide to go get help then thats your problem . it is nobody  s fault but your own that you are refusing to save yourself . i dont think anyone physically restrains you to keep you from going to any appointments .

3. when do you think they stopped inciting riots ? where is the last one that it happened to ? what event happened that lead the police to belive it wasn ' t worth doing anymore ? yeah . it ' s a conspiracy theory . people are conspiring to do something illegal or morally wrong . are you trying to insult me or something ? also , chill with the personal insults . if you are capable of sharing your opinion , you shouldn ' t have to resort to them .

   (ID: 033f2c18bf4595efe99c78c096a0b763ff7f2eb3)

7. there ' s someone for everyone  they ' re out they ' re waiting you and all other shitty variations to give people false hope . to me it ' s better to think " if it happens , it happens "
   (ID: 7eb8e919a32aaaa4562b811575e7a335d4580896)

8. i think it works for some people but very rarely . i couldn ' t do it , i ' d get way too jealous , plus i ' m gay and terrified of hiv
   (ID: db22fa06c3753990177c16d9fd807312ea6d7838)

9. cynical answer  moderately difficult , if you ' re a fascist . nigh  impossible for everyone else . " okay fine i ' ll actually think about it for ten whole seconds " answer  i suspect that being friends with many people who are already verified can speed the process , somehow .
   (ID: 7a0793bcbf5ebd7652d813113d7574767774370f)

10. same here ! i guess we can plan something for the end of the month . perhaps on the 28th ? hmm , where to go though ? i can ' t think of anything personally . suggestions people , suggestions !

11. agreed , i think this list shows how far reddit has its head up its ass . people joke about the hivemind but this list really shows it
   (ID: 1dba5a99fe582b0f335d63ef3d25fee74ce4dd18)

12. depends on kirito ' s mentality really . desperation is a hell of drug and it ' s one of the reasons he was able to win in a lot of the fights in alicization . it ' s a contriversial opinion than a few people here probably won ' t agree with but i think that the integrity knights are a lot more skilled than yuuki from the sheer accumulated experience as well as their rammed up crazy stats .
   (ID: 3dbd15daab95154ec4872b4efd814648d62f3f8d)

13. soulmates are something you build together . so , there are soulmates , but not the way people think , i guess
   (ID: e216f2a1e0d7d814b7ad58452ce6ac21e0b763fc)

14. simple , never think or talk to yourself ever again . whenever you talk to other people , wear noise cancelling headphones .
   (ID: df34d344a5961b9a821338e2eb9cc83b690b3b37)

15. why do people think it is awe  inspiring to make some form of poke at an obvious exaggeration ?
   (ID: 13f3637bbb579882bd110c0601fbdfad6fd7127e)

16. there ' s an element of porn poisoning in there as well . incels seem to have developed some very unrealistic expectations of women and sex  the " berries and cream " effect , we could call that  and become angry when these expectations are not met . they think other people are having a great deal more sex than is actually the fact .
   (ID: 17915f3ca5f214aa5ff19f14bb13c180768068ab)

17. in my experience it ' s not about damnation so much as being disconnected from the source of morality . but you ' re still right , there are religious people who do think it ' s about fear of punishment .
   (ID: 185be404846a8d1d8a884b3ccafea84e2a4e4f25)

18. tell them you ' ll rape them . yes you ' ll be an awful person and deserve the worst . but that ' s a sure firenway to actually trigger them . no , i ' m not supporting anyone doing this . rape is no joke and i think that it ' s a damn shame that people now use the word " trigger " to describe stupid issues .
   (ID: ed3145ac8fb4051a8199e65589f22ec3606b58fd)

19. the problem is i can  t prove any of it , it  s only the two of us at night so there are no witnesses . my manager and supervisor are aware of the screaming incident , all i have are the emails between my manager and i that document what happened . the other people she  s done this to have left . i never went through with the counselling assistance my manager offered , which i think now can be held against me .
   (ID: d3f6a1d7a8465df4e92e95035fa4dce79a0c3913)

20. i find tattoos attractive . i think this is the goal of people using them .
