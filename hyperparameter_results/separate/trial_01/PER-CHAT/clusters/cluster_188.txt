1. like these dudes really blame any small thing just because they can ' t get pussy or anything , and they think relatively high of themselves , it disgusts me . maybe all these women didn ' t give him a chance because he has such a big ego .

2. what do you do for work ? do you like it ? could this tiredness be stemming from boredom and maybe you need to find something more stimulating and interesting ? when i worked at my old job retail merchandising i was always on my feet and would be so tired after my shift and sometimes during it . when i felt tired during i felt lazy and not as productive . i think it was because i started to get burnt out and bored of my job . then i switched careers and felt totally different . that ' s just me though , maybe your situation is a little different .

3. to me the show is mostly a story of self perseverance , not friendship , and most of the have some sort of drawback or limitation especially the main characters which can be pretty dark at times . if i was to compare it to your list i would say it most closely resembles naruto it is shonen jump after all . rather or not you  ll like it i can  t say just watch a few episodes and see what you think , hope this help give you an idea of the show at least

5. i ' ve had something like this before . it sucks and kinda hurts the ego , but i think it ' s best to just step back and distance yourself from the person a bit .

6. it ' s most likely dehydration . just like when you had alcohol you become dehydrated and therefore get similar result when training . your body is also not used to that level of exercise so it chocks the body . start smaller and work your way up is better for the body . also drink more water than you think you need , there ' s a reason why the athletes carry around a gallon of water at all times during preseason . hope your training will go better in the future , and sorry for the bad grammar english is my third language .

8. i ' ve heard flight control makes fun of you , i think it ' s funny as hell . like the guy said , it ' s not a bad thing , just a preference and a sacrifice of an internal .

9. yeah but in universe it would make more sense for something like this it  s just a theory and there  s no need to make them feel bad for having an idea gravity falls was a kids show , more so than voltron and yet think of all the mysteries and secrets the fans had to figure out themselves if it  s a well made show then no matter the age range theory  s can still be valid

10. i  m not mad , i just feel like most questions on this subreddit are subjective . we got a number of comments that were different , so clearly reddit can think for themselves . not sure what your deal is buddy .

11. i agree , i think we can also say the same about the hundreds of million innocent muslims throughout the world . just like this mans actions do not represent the military as a whole , i hope we can learn to not aggregate anyone who says they are muslim and categorize them as a terrorist .

14. well , i am definitely more of an introvert . i feel that i most of my interactions are just me awkwardly interjecting in other ' s conversations because nobody is talking to me in the first place . i am definitely socially awkward and that is no help . i get told i never smile . maybe i should do that more often . and i like the idea of that type of small talk you mentioned , i think i will try that .

15. there was this girl holding a sword and when i asked her why she just said that she always came prepared . i ' d like to think that she and her friends were actually having some variety of supernatural adventures right beneath all our noses .
   (ID: c6cc92fb6dee5f65446e9383372864b9e25f1d60)

   (ID: 2eaae893aae1f80f60648fa3fbcbe961d0639556)

19. cause you ' ll most likely remember it and think about it . just like you are dooing now . by that , the brand gets embedded in your memory . for that kind of advert , it ' s not important if it ' s postie or negative feedback .
   (ID: 4009cc20ad03edb42bfbc6727a4218979c8c8cde)

20. no , just the idea of your precious weed not being so great and holy like you think it is . and what ' s wrong with being anti abortion ?
