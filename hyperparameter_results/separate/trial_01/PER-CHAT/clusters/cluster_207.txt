11. i was at a movie theater , and the popcorn guy said " hey , your haircut is really cool ! " and i felt so good about myself . a good rule of thumb , non  sexual compliments on something they can easily control  change . it also felt like a more genuine thought than , " hey you ' re pretty " . it was more specific and made the guy seem nice and encouraging to actually have a conversation with .

12. i ' d welcome a good reason not to be as angry as i am right now . wellthatsucks that you ' re angry . yes , i get sick of the sponsored posts and content . and when sites try to bombard you with ads ? that happens way too often and is exactly the reason why we use an ad blocker . dumbfuccs like you are those who are somehow " appalled " that users use adblock plus and ublock origin yet are being absolute hypocrites because you ' re loading up the page with ads .

   (ID: 81ba0631824b4cc9c9261bcca7be4a70aad2ea12)

17. talk about how each of you like to maintain cleanliness around your individual spaces . one of you may like to wash dishes right away while the other prefers to do it once a week . if you get a good understanding of how each of you would function if you lived alone and then start a plan for how you ' re going to compromise before living together , you can help yourselves avoid some tension that will naturally come up when cohabiting .

18. i mean if we  re going notes  speed i  d say nothing else matters but some solos like in run to the hills are good aswell .

19. obviously great depends on your definition of great . if you like social programs and high life satisfaction levels , you have scandinavia . if you like crushing everyone else with money , media , and military might then america is pretty good .

20. discover new and fun hobbies . also improving yourself in anyway possible is great , like going to the gym and eating well and do it for yourself . if you feel good and happy with yourself then you  ll radiate that energy !
