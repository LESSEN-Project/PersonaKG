   (ID: 7f32a549f01ae8b1c5a6e3c929488e44322434d4)

2. well , no , because we can use it and control it doesn ' t mean that we know for a " fact " what it is , it is still only a theory . it hasn ' t been observed doing what we think that it does .

6. the prestige . i ' m not entirely sure i understand the very last scene , which shows hugh jackman ' s character in the water chamber device and then we see a bubble emerge . is he breathing ? is he still alive ? i . e . his clone etc . i think i get it but i ' m not 10o  sure about the final message of that very last shot . inception i understood completely , but the prestige has me confused as to what the ultimate goal of the ending really meant . if anyone can shed some light on that last shot i ' d love to know their interpretation .

7. that one demonic face on it . the one that was scary as shit . i think you know what i  m talking about
   (ID: d4326ed543a6135d5c4ed51580bbdb131a2f088c)

8. all depends on your background and motives . empathy of someone is a must . for me , as a nice guy trust me please . you need this one thing , secret tip . you need to process that every person , even at worse has had a different situation to you in the past and you do not know where , or how they became who they are . you look at yourself , and your traits and be thankful , postives overcome negatives if you think that .

9. unfortunately it ' s unrealistic to think that college age individuals and some adults will know what causes variable interest rates to go up and down . also many banks will give out student loans because they always need to be paid back , unless they are forgiven , which is an entirely different beast . i know when i took out my loans for school the lender were throwing out jargon left and right . giving scenarios that wouldn ' t occur . i was lucky since i went to school for accounting i knew what the lender was trying to pull . my point is it ' s a game between the borrower and the lender , where the borrower must learn and understand the rules the lender is forcing them into .

10. it ' s been seventeen years since i graduated , and no one has ever mentioned having one and i was the treasurer , so the president and i are the only ones who can access the money to pay for it . honestly , i couldn ' t care less . i think in the age of social media , it makes the notion of high school reunions rather pointless . you already know what everyone ' s up to , their jobs , families , etc .

11. when looking for new locations , do you actively chase waterfalls ? it would seem to me the better way would be to stick to the rivers and the lakes that you ' re used to . i know that you ' re gonna have it your way or nothing at all , but i think you ' re moving too fast .

12. either will or eleven . we seem to think we know a lot about them already , but do we really ? also of course their connection to the upside down is really interesting .

13. i know what they mean . he  s saying it  s genuine  i . e . not sped up  because of the effort in the guy  s face . i can well believe it , oriental chefs have mind  blowing knife skills , especially the japanese remember much of what the japs consider delicacies will kill you if not prepared properly . i agree , i think this is genuine .

14. i think that ' s how he know ' s there ' s no country for him anymore , not because he ' s old , but because he ' s can ' t do the work anymore , he ' s " old .
   (ID: 93dbf8824e6719692322da6dc96f3b74f3f5458f)

   (ID: fea2d97b012abe66dccd2110eeb14be10ad8aba6)

17. yea for sure , thanks for the response . how do you think i should take a step back without making it wierd for him ? it is such a drastic change to go from hanging every day for so long to not that much you know .
   (ID: f7dd8de47d80ce80a12584645de24d9967972760)

18. when she ' s a race that has made zero inventions , i think we all know who the racist is .
   (ID: 668f906262f23d360a23b9ed09cf48055dbd08d3)

19. at what point in one ' s life does someone think to themselves " you know what , i ' m going to dedicate countless hours to the art of cutting up watermelon " ?
