13. gonna be honest  i only had to lane against tahm kench once , but i think the best way to deal with him is , of course , by keeping your distance and staying behind your minions if you can so he can ' t hit you with q and by keeping trades very short so he can ' t effectively use e and so he can ' t get digit stacks and eat you . also because he is so tanky even in the early game that you can basically go all  in on him and he can drag out the fight so much that his jungler can come from botlane to help and when he arrives kench still isn ' t dead .
