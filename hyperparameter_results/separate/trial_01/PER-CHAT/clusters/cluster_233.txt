1. i don ' t think that an occasional moment of doubt or questioning means you made a mistake in your marriage . it makes you human .
   (ID: 022767076c8e9ed224fa7eeaf7db901f4f85512b)

2. at our house , in hungary . and i don ' t really think so . they are a bit poor to restore theirs . not meant to flex
   (ID: a3fb77c8859551c5756792dfce5f2f01dc362742)

3. instead of tucking me in to bed as a kid with the whole " don ' t let the bed bugs bite " deal , my mom would kiss me goodnight and say " you can do or be anything you put your mind to " and i think hearing that every night developed my confidence and strength for the rest of my life so far

4. i wish i had taken a snippet . i looked through amazon ' s site to see if i could find a transcript , but they don ' t make them available . anyway the rep ' s response was hahahaha he probably told it to all his friends . he also gave me very favorable service after that . i think they get chewed out a lot .
   (ID: ba36378938166df5b4246ac6a85496534b249814)

5. i think it ' s gotten worse recently . police will always harass you until you give them money . lots of shady businesses that are obviously run by cartels and shit . also depends on where you go . i sure as hell will never step foot in juarez . but long as you don ' t do anything stupid then you ' ll be ok .

6. i don ' t think it ' s worth the effort but ok
   (ID: 4e2fa6f27a1d1e593b4d7f007fea784cb7cbfc65)

7. i was only addressing a possible talking point . i don  t understand what you  re getting so excited for . and i don  t think anyone would disagree that families need to deal with their loved ones no longer having the ability to responsibly own firearms . i was only suggesting a possible worst case example of government intervention
   (ID: fdd0825d18a21ec85f13433419ea80d6b3a3a4c4)

8. i don  t think so . same happened to my squad day one of this game . i don  t think you  re truly respawned until your boots hit the ground and you  re done with the falling animation . could be wrong though
   (ID: e96655e0e2f2fbd508b9d42c86e7d1c431fd6b4e)

9. don ' t think you should be getting downvoted , let ' s not forget 8pts and ' mind the gap ' . either way , we can all agree , wherever everyone finishes , we have a much better team , a better stadium , a better training ground and a much brighter future !
   (ID: 0ffa7f8636d1194237fe522c87c777aa98b0f3ad)

10. i don ' t think you can be blind and deaf by birth
   (ID: c65a473965fbe88679c85b0d206d90b8c65789fe)

11. no , i don  t . i think humans came up with the idea of  a greater purpose  in order to make life feel more worth living , and to justify the tragedies and horrors they saw and continue to see on a day  to  day basis . same thing with the creation of gods . it creates some kind of logic and comfort for when the world can be a truly harsh place .
   (ID: 3adf883c491ca030d52ee22ed62e166c87ed0d5e)

12. hmm . i don ' t think it can see its own reflection from there .
   (ID: d306fdc150cd289e266e785107cfceff83aa649c)

13. i wouldn ' t say i have a big ass . it ' s not flat either , i think it ' s nice and i always check myself out in the mirror , but i would only say it ' s a little above average . i don ' t think ass size has anything to do with it though .
   (ID: 6646dc228dccad2f1b450fb533b5a42d85536450)

14. i think what he ' s getting at is the idea that if someone is mentally unhinged example , a psychopath they don ' t really have control over what they do . the brain is the control center of everything we do . if its fucked up , then the person is basically screwed .
   (ID: f903d9b4ab2ed2813eb60579aa407d7730187596)

15. a pillar of the gaming community is gone . and there isnt anyone that will replace him i don ' t think . it ' s a sad day but at least the man is finally free from his pain .
